What Do Google’s AI Answers Cost the Environment?
What Do Google’s AI Answers Cost the Environment?
Google is bringing AI answers to a billion people this year, but generative AI requires much more energy than traditional keyword searches

What medications cure headaches? Should you kill cicadas? If you Google these questions in the U.S., answers may pop up directly at top of the results page—products of “AI Overviews,” the latest artificial intelligence offerings from the search engine giant. Google, which handles more than 90 percent of Internet searches worldwide, has promised to bring this feature to one billion people by the end of 2024. Other tech companies may follow suit; Microsoft’s search engine Bing has also introduced a similar AI option.
Gemini, Google’s family of large language models, generates the text found in AI Overviews. These systems are powerful but not flawless. In the weeks since the feature’s debut, it has recommended gluing cheese to pizza, for instance, and changing a car’s blinker fluid.* But these early flubs, which Google chalked up to misinterpretations or a lack of data, have so far overshadowed another possible drawback: the financial and environmental cost of AI search. Embedding generative AI in such a widely used application is likely to deepen the tech sector’s hunger for fossil fuels and water.
When compared to traditional search engines, AI uses “orders of magnitude more energy,” says Sasha Luccioni of the AI research company Hugging Face, who studies how these technologies impact the environment. “It just makes sense, right?” While a mundane search query finds existing data from the Internet, she says, applications like AI Overviews must create entirely new information; Luccioni’s team has estimated it costs about 30 times as much energy to generate text versus simply extracting it from a source.

Big tech companies typically do not disclose the resources required to run their models, but outside researchers such as Luccioni have come up with estimates (though these numbers are highly variable and depend on an AI’s size and its task). She and her colleagues calculated that the large language model BLOOM emitted greenhouse gases equivalent to 19 kilograms of CO2 per day of use, or the amount generated by driving 49 miles in an average gas-powered car. They also found that generating two images with AI could use as much energy as the average smartphone charge. Others have estimated in research posted on the preprint server arXiv.org that every 10 to 50 responses from ChatGPT running GPT-3 evaporate the equivalent of a bottle of water to cool the AI’s servers.
Such demands translate to financial costs. John Hennessy, chair of Google’s parent company Alphabet, told Reuters last year that an exchange with a large language model could cost 10 times more than a traditional search, though he predicted that those costs would decrease as the models are fine-tuned. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that if AI generated 50-word answers in response to 50 percent of queries, it could cost Google $6 billion dollars per year. (Alphabet reported $300 billion in revenue in 2023.)
When asked about the costs of generative AI compared to traditional search, a Google spokesperson told Scientific American that “machine costs associated with [generative] AI responses have decreased 80 percent from when [the feature was] first introduced in [Google’s feature incubator] Labs, driven by hardware, engineering and technical breakthroughs.”
Data centers, including those that house AI servers, currently represent about 1.5 percent of global energy usage but are projected to double by 2026, at which point they may collectively use as much power as the country of Japan does today. Generative AI itself is expected to consume 10 times more energy in 2026 than it did in 2023. To accommodate these growing power needs, Google and other big tech companies are building out their computing infrastructure. Google is spending billions on new data centers in Missouri, Indiana and Iowa. Microsoft and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, are meanwhile working on a $100 billion plan to increase their power capacity.
Many tech companies say they plan to shift away from using fossil fuels for their growing computing needs. IBM, for example, has said that renewable energy accounted for 74 percent of its data center energy usage in 2023. Google has set a goal to match 100 percent of its energy usage each hour with purchases of carbon-free energy by 2030, and it achieved an average of 64 percent in 2022, the most recent year for which data are available. This number was relatively flat compared with that of 2021 “despite [a] significant expansion of carbon-free energy supply ... because of the significant growth in our total electricity load,” according to the company’s 2023 Environmental Report.
A major challenge in switching to renewable energy is that data centers’ need for constant, stable power often does not match the rhythm of renewable energy production, which fluctuates—sometimes unpredictably—throughout the day, explains Shaolei Ren, a computer engineer at the University of California, Riverside, who studies sustainable AI. To support the demand for stable power, fossil-fuel plants are staying online longer than planned, especially in Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” and other tech-dense areas of the country.
“There's a supply and demand mismatch for this renewable energy,” says Benjamin Lee, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, who studies AI’s environmental impact. He adds that data centers may solve this problem in the future by scheduling their computing needs to match the availability of renewable energy or by investing in batteries to store it.
While Google’s AI answers may initially cause a big jump in the search engine’s energy costs, the costs may begin to decrease again as engineers figure out how to make the system more efficient, says Rama Ramakrishnan, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management with expertise in the tech industry. “The number of searches going through a [large language model] is going to go up..., and therefore, probably, the energy costs are going to go up. But I think the cost per query seems to be going down” as the company works to make both the hardware and software more efficient, he says.
“It’s difficult to predict” what this means for the cost of generative AI compared to traditional search, Ramakrishnan says. “My guess is that it’s probably going to go up, but it’s probably not going to go up dramatically.”
Whether this increased cost is worth it depends on the value users find in the AI answers. Links provided by AI Overviews get more traffic than those in traditional search listings, and people wind up spending more time on those websites, an indication that users are satisfied with the search result, the Google spokesperson says.
“Some people will be like, ‘Okay, that’s worth it. I'm ready to emit that much more carbon in order to have that kind of result,’” Luccioni says, “whereas other people [would] rather use the legacy Google search.” Users currently do not have a simple option to turn the AI Overviews feature off, however, meaning that the search engine is computing answers that many people may not want or need.
Still, even when given a choice, the public may have a hard time connecting digital actions to invisible real-world costs. “Cloud [computing] has made things incredibly convenient, and as a result, many people use it as if it were free because they don’t incur the cost of it,” Lee says.
Luccioni is currently working on a project to give Energy Star ratings to different AI models and types of tasks. She says she hopes this would help AI users make more informed choices. “We know that there’s a cost to this,” she says. “We should know what that cost is.”

						EPA Finalizes New Greenhouse Gas Reporting Obligations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: More Companies Impacted; More Fees Charged					
On May 14, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems under 40 C.F.R. Part 98, Subpart W in the Federal Register. The changes to this rule resulted from passing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) which required EPA to develop standards to collect payment on methane from facilities that exceed specific thresholds. The new rule expands the reporting requirement to apply to additional facilities, adds and improves methods for calculating and detecting emissions, and finalizes confidentiality determinations for certain data elements. The final rule applies to a wide range of oil and gas facilities operated by the petroleum production, gas transmission, and utility industries. It will impose significant administrative and recordkeeping costs on those industries, as well as requiring them to pay fees for reported methane emissions.
Background and Affected Facilities
The IRA amended the Clean Air Act to include a mandate that EPA establish standards for reporting and calculating payments based on “empirical data […], accurately reflect the total methane emissions and waste emissions from the applicable facilities, and allow owners and operators of applicable facilities to submit empirical emissions data.” 42 U.S.C. § 7436(h). Owners and operators of facilities that report over 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent will be required to collect greenhouse gas data; calculate greenhouse gas emissions; and follow the specified procedures for quality assurance, missing data, recordkeeping, and reporting. Based on that data, owners and operators must also pay a fee for methane emissions based on specified thresholds. 42 U.S.C. § 7436(c). The affected facilities include petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, onshore natural gas transmission compression, underground natural gas storage, liquified natural gas storage, liquified natural gas import and export equipment, onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting, and onshore natural gas transmission pipelines. 42 U.S.C. § 7436(d). EPA’s comments to the final rule discuss the use of satellite and other “advanced technologies” to monitor emissions and, according to their Fact Sheet for the final rule, EPA may seek additional input on the use of advanced technologies to facilitate monitoring and measuring methane emissions.
Reporting Obligations
The rule is notable given the significant number and type of sources required to report. Under the rule, covered facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from essentially all oil and gas equipment and components, examples of which include natural gas pneumatic device venting, flare stack emissions, reciprocating compressor venting, dehydrator vents, acid gas removal vents, enhanced oil recovery hydrocarbon liquids dissolved CO2, blowdown vent stacks, and equipment leaks. 40 C.F.R. § 98.232. The new rule also requires reporting for emissions from “other large release events” to “capture maintenance or abnormal emission events that are not fully accounted for using existing methods in subpart W” such as pipeline venting or methane released at a storage facility due to an overpressure situation that results in a release of 100 kilograms or more of methane in an hour. Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, 89 Fed. Reg. 42,062, 42,078 (May 14, 2024) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 98). The new rule also modifies the formulas that facilities use to calculate emissions, requiring existing reporting methodologies to be updated.
The final rule also mandates public reporting of these emissions. EPA allows only certain data elements to be considered for confidential treatment. Data elements eligible for confidential treatment include the quantity of natural gas received for processing in the calendar year, the quantity of processed gas leaving the gas processing plant in the calendar year, and the quantity of residue gas leaving that has been processed by the facility.
Finally, the timing of the final rule gives facilities only limited time to prepare for compliance. The rule will take effect on January 1, 2025, except for facilities specifically exempted under 40 C.F.R. §§ 98.233, 98.236, and 98.238, and for which the final rule’s requirements become effective July 15, 2024. The expressed purpose for this short effective date is to allow certain facilities to submit empirical emissions data while using the revised formulas and reporting methodology required by the new rule. While the rule has not yet been challenged, we anticipate that it may be, and any challenge may draw upon recent decisions related to Chevron’s deference and the Major Questions Doctrine.

Under the rule, covered facilities must report CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from essentially all oil and gas equipment and components, examples of which include natural gas pneumatic device venting, flare stack emissions, reciprocating compressor venting, dehydrator vents, acid gas removal vents, enhanced oil recovery hydrocarbon liquids dissolved CO2, blowdown vent stacks, and equipment leaks. 40 C.F.R. § 98.232. The new rule also requires reporting for emissions from “other large release events” to “capture maintenance or abnormal emission events that are not fully accounted for using existing methods in subpart W” such as pipeline venting or methane released at a storage facility due to an overpressure situation that results in a release of 100 kilograms or more of methane in an hour. Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, 89 Fed. Reg. 42,062, 42,078 (May 14, 2024) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 98). The new rule also modifies the formulas that facilities use to calculate emissions, requiring existing reporting methodologies to be updated.\nThe final rule also mandates public reporting of these emissions. EPA allows only certain data elements to be considered for confidential treatment. Data elements eligible for confidential treatment include the quantity of natural gas received for processing in the calendar year, the quantity of processed gas leaving the gas processing plant in the calendar year, and the quantity of residue gas leaving that has been processed by the facility.\nFinally, the timing of the final rule gives facilities only limited time to prepare for compliance. The rule will take effect on January 1, 2025, except for facilities specifically exempted under 40 C.F.R. §§ 98.233, 98.236, and 98.238, and for which the final rule’s requirements become effective July 15, 2024. The expressed purpose for this short effective date is to allow certain facilities to submit empirical emissions data while using the revised formulas and reporting methodology required by the new rule. While the rule has not yet been challenged, we anticipate that it may be, and any challenge may draw upon recent decisions related to Chevron’s deference and the Major Questions Doctrine.\nFor additional information on the final rule or assistance with reporting obligations under the final rule, contact Pete Tomasi, Amanda Beggs, or Katherine Plachta at Foley & Lardner LLP.\nAuthors\nSectors\nPractice Areas\nAuthor(s)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeter\t\t\t\t\tA.\t\t\t\t\tTomasi\t\t\t\t\n\nPartner\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmanda\t\t\t\t\tK.\t\t\t\t\tBeggs\t\t\t\t\n\nSenior Counsel\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKatherine\t\t\t\t\tM.\t\t\t\t\tPlachta\t\t\t\t\n\nAssociate\nRelated Insights\nThe Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) announced on May 23, 2024, the awardees for Round 1 of the Wisconsin Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (WEVI) Plan\nTexas Legislature Energy Outlook\nWhat Every Multinational Company Should Know About … New Solar Panel Antidumping & Countervailing Duty Investigations\nWe look beyond the law to focus on the constantly evolving demands facing our clients.\n© 2024 Foley & Lardner LLP    \nAttorney Advertisement   \nImages of people may not be Foley personnel.        \n'}]","{'tone': 'negative', 'sentiment': 'negative', 'summary': 'The commenter believes that the decision will be overturned by the Supreme Court, which is seen as being favorable towards corporate interests.'}","[""The commenter's belief that the Supreme Court will overturn this decision is simply misguided and wishful thinking.

How radical should you be when you’re trying to save the planet?
In the 2022 film How to Blow Up a Pipeline, a group of young climate activists get together to blow up a pipeline in Texas. The movie is fictional, but the book it’s adapted from is not. In the 2021 book, author Andreas Malm argues that sabotage and property damage are valid tactics to confront fossil fuel use and calls for an escalation in tactics.
We should “[d]amage and destroy new CO2-emitting devices,” Malm writes. “Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up. Let the capitalists who keep investing in the fire know that their properties will be trashed.”
Climate activists have yet to go that far, but they’re doing lots of other things.
Last week’s Climate Week events, timed to the UN General Assembly, drew thousands of protesters to New York. Over 100 people were arrested for blockading the entrances to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York while calling on financial regulators to stop funding fossil fuel companies. At the New York March to End Fossil Fuels, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told a cheering crowd, “We must be too big and too radical to ignore.”
Climate activists have heeded that call. In recent months, they staged a die-in at New York’s Museum of Modern Art to draw attention to a board member’s investments in fossil fuel projects, blocked the entrances to the Philadelphia-area headquarters of investment manager Vanguard, and dyed the water of Rome’s Trevi Fountain black. Demonstrators disrupted rush-hour commutes everywhere from Boston and Washington, DC, to Berlin and the Hague, and even snarled traffic on the road to Burning Man, creating miles of gridlock.
Dana R. Fisher, a professor at American University, studies climate policymaking and climate activism. Her forthcoming book, Saving Ourselves: From Climate Shocks to Climate Action (Columbia University Press, 2024), investigates this growing radical flank and uses data to explain the increasing use of civil disobedience within the climate movement.
Fisher spoke with Today, Explained host Noel King about what she has learned from spending time with activists and where she sees the movement heading. Read on for an excerpt of the conversation, edited and condensed for length and clarity, and listen to the full conversation wherever you find podcasts.
Dana, I think there’s a sense that climate activism is becoming more radical. Is that true?
Since the Biden administration took office, we’ve seen a growing radical flank, which is those people who are engaging in more confrontational and radical tactics around climate change.
These are folks who are doing something that’s against social norms, like, for example, throwing food on the covering of a work of art. We’ve seen people using Krazy Glue in all sorts of crazy ways in the past few years, and that’s become much more common, even recently with the activist who glued his bare feet to the stands at the US Open, as well as an activist who glued his hand to the lectern [at a televised debate] in Switzerland recently. Other types of radical tactics include blocking traffic and slow walking, which is a really interesting new tactic.
But these are all radical in that they’re outside the norm of the ways that the environmental movement and the climate movement have worked in recent years, which tends to be much more institutional and much more focused on working through the political system rather than outside of it.
I saw a video recently of some climate activists who were in Washington, DC, where I live, and they were blocking traffic. People were walking up to them and saying, “I need to get to work.” I mean, these people were really upset. Do these kinds of actions help or hurt the cause of climate activists?
The people who are actually doing this type of confrontational activism — which I’m calling in my new book “activism to shock,” and I use the term “shockers” to refer to these activists — these shockers are actually trying to shock the general public into paying attention to the climate crisis. Now, is it going to piss people off? Absolutely. And there’s lots of evidence of that. But one of the things that we know from the research is that while specific actions in specific groups that engage in these more radical tactics tend to turn off people, research shows that it does shine light on the climate crisis and actually draws attention to and support for more moderate groups and more moderate forms of activism. So in the broader movement, it may be quite effective, but for these specific activists and the tactics they’re using and the groups that they’re working with — and I know the groups that were blocking traffic recently here in DC — it’s completely unpopular.
Well, what would they say? If you asked them, “Was that successful when you guys blocked traffic?” Is the answer, “We got media attention”?
The answer, they would say, is, “Absolutely.” They really want the conversation to start with their activism and continue into the climate crisis. They’ll basically say, “We tried going to a legally permitted march, we tried carrying signs, we tried going to our elected officials’ offices.” And I can tell you from data I’ve collected that they do all of those things. And what they’ll say is, it doesn’t work. It’s not gotten the attention. It hasn’t helped change the conversation. But sitting on the street or gluing myself to the tarmac — when the media starts to talk about it, it helps us to start to have these conversations about what’s needed to address the climate crisis.
You spend a lot of time with these folks. Who is a typical climate activist?
Generally, the climate movement is very similar to the left-leaning movements that we’ve observed over the past five, seven years here in the United States. And that is they tend to be highly educated, predominantly white, and majority female.
Is there a type of person who becomes radical or becomes radicalized?
We don’t have a lot of data on the people who are engaging in the radical flank or participating in the radical flank. There’s anecdotal evidence, and a lot of the anecdotal evidence is people who have been engaged for quite some time and then became really frustrated with the lack of progress, and so started thinking, “We need to be more engaged and more confrontational to get more attention.”
Other movements have started out less radical and then radicalized over time, right?
In my new book, I actually talk specifically about the civil rights period and the civil rights movement, which was also this broad-based movement.
The civil rights movement started out as working through much more traditional institutional channels in the hope of ending Jim Crow and also to give Black Americans the vote. And younger activists or younger members of the movement got extremely frustrated with that and basically decided they needed to do more, and they decided to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience. So we saw sit-ins, and they basically would just go places and sit in and occupy and refuse to leave, which is nonviolent activism. It’s similar to blocking the street. In response to that, there were counter-movements that mobilized — we call them white supremacists today — as well as law enforcement, both of whom were relatively aggressive and in some cases violent against these nonviolent activists who are engaging in civil disobedience.
And it was that process that led to more radicalization of more activists because they saw predominantly Black young people being beaten up on national television.
But in addition to that, it also mobilized and motivated sympathizers to get involved in supporting the movement. And that is what a lot of scholars who study the civil rights movement say is the reason why the civil rights movement was successful, but also why we saw this big shift in policymaking in the United States.
I think that we could see something very similar happen around the climate crisis, but we’re going to see a lot more civil disobedience before that happens, for sure.
On violence, let me ask you about How To Blow Up a Pipeline. This is a book released in 2021 by the writer Andreas Malm. What is the argument that’s being made in this text initially that then gets adapted into a movie?
The nugget that’s still in this adaptation is about frustration with the process of addressing the climate crisis and the degree to which incremental change, which is all that has been possible through policymakers, through business efforts thus far, is absolutely insufficient to solve the climate crisis.
And then we go down this road of these young people who are going to literally try to blow up a pipeline, right, and why they’re doing it.
Right. So this is what I’m really curious about is, the book has the most provocative title in the world. It’s like The Anarchist Cookbook.
And it’s a beautiful orange cover. I’m looking at it right now.
Then it becomes a movie. And so, from where I sit as somebody who is not a researcher but a journalist, it’s like, “Oh, that has made it into the zeitgeist.” And so the thing I’m curious about is, when that book comes out, does anyone proceed to then blow up a pipeline? Is anything moving in that direction?
I mean, are there people out there in the United States and around the world who are thinking about how they need to form these eco-terrorist cells because the climate crisis is real and nothing’s being done about it? Probably. But I don’t think that they read Malm’s work and they said, “Oh, an orange book. Now I’m going to radicalize.” I think they were already there and they were already thinking we are nowhere near where we need to be.
The more frustration we see people having with businesses and the state and the government because it is insufficiently addressing the problem, we’re going to see more people who get fed up to the point where they mobilize. And the more people who are mobilizing, the more that radical flank is necessarily going to expand.

    Even though you're replying to the other comments, your reply must contain content from this article - Biden restores protections to Alaska's Tongass National Forest
Joel Jackson, the president of the Organized Village of Kake, a tribal community, has lived within the Tongass National Forest in Alaska his entire life. His community relies on the land for hunting deer and fishing salmon that swim in streams kept cold by the old-growth forest. 
But the 66-year-old worried about damage to that land - the largest national forest in the US - after former President Donald Trump rescinded a measure blocking logging and road-building on nine million acres of land in the Tongass in 2020. 
""The forest is key to our survival as a people, to our way of life … for thousands of years,"" Mr Jackson said. 
Last week marked a long-awaited victory for Mr Jackson and other tribes and environmental groups who petitioned the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to reinstate the protections for the forest. 
The agency announced last Wednesday it would once again ban logging and the construction of roads for cutting timber in over half of the Tongass.
The decision follows a years-long conflict between Alaskan Republican officials - who have argued the rule has slowed economic development and that renewing it will hamper efforts to connect remote communities by road, among other concerns - and conservationists, indigenous groups and others who say the measure is key to protecting the environment. 
Spanning nearly 17 million acres - an area slightly larger than the state of West Virginia - the Tongass stores 44% of all the carbon dioxide contained in national forests across the country, according to the Alaska Conservation Foundation. 
One of the world's largest intact temperate rainforests, it is home to 800-year-old cedar, hemlock and Sitka spruce trees that help provide habitats for over 400 species of land and marine wildlife. 
Environmental experts view protecting the forest as key to conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. 
The decision to reinstate a rule blocking logging and road-building in the Tongass reflects the voices of Tribal Nations and the people of Southeast Alaska, while taking into account the importance of fishing and tourism to the region's economy, US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a recent statement. 
The protections - known as a ""roadless rule"" regulation - were first introduced by former President Bill Clinton's administration in 2001 to shield certain designated areas in US national forests from logging. 
In 2020, after lobbying from Alaskan state officials, Mr Trump stripped the protections for the Tongass. 
In a statement last week, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, argued the Biden Administration's decision to reinstate protections turned ""the Tongass into a political football"", and would hinder local economic development.
Her comments were echoed by her senate colleague Dan Sullivan, who pledged in a statement to ""fight this decision with everything in my power"", while Governor Mike Dunleavy called the USDA's move a ""huge loss for Alaskans"".
But several local businesses and organisations said they disagreed. 
Gordon Chew, a co-owner of Tenakee Logging Company, a small family-owned business in the area, said lumber jobs have declined in the Tongass National Forest over the past three decades. But he said this is because of factors such as rising fuel prices for transporting timber from an isolated Alaska and not due to the roadless rule. 
""If you believe in global warming, see the value of sequestering carbon, and you like the fishing industry and support tourism, these are all things that the roadless rule enhances,"" he said.
The roadless rule was always ""contentious with Alaska politicians, but not so contentious with the public"", said Meredith Trainor, the executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. 
She argued it is ""really important to have the rule in place to have another impediment to a resurgence of logging in these intact forest areas"". 
While Mr Jackson celebrated the rule change, he said he would not feel relieved until such protections are made permanent, a move he said could require congressional approval. 
That could be his next battle, he said.
""I describe walking into the forest as walking into one of the most beautiful cathedrals you'll ever find in the world,"" he said. ""I don't want to have my grandchildren, their grandchildren, to have to fight for that too.""

Not even close.\n\nFact checkers have attempted to downplay reports that gas stoves will be banned along with gas home heating (oil, LPG), etc. But if our leaders feel that nuclear war is preferable to climate change, then electric appliances and home heating must also be preferable to gas, so it follows that the laws will change to reflect this. (The world\'s top chefs better retrain for induction cooktops!)\n\nIt won\'t be long before there is no new home construction in which gas hookups are permitted. Is the natural gas industry and all those people they employ reading the writing on the wall on this? If not, how come we don\'t see oil and gas executives going on Fox News every other day to cry about how their industries are about to die? Well, I might have a theory on that:\n\nThe Biden administration effort to implement the Green New Deal (aka Inflation Reduction Act) might make a certain amount of sense if A) nuclear energy was the proposed substitute or B) some other life-changing technological breakthrough had occurred. But climate emergency proponents don\'t want nuclear energy either. So basically it comes down to wind and solar on a scale necessary to duplicate 2023 levels of energy consumption in the United States. I have seen estimates that replacing what is currently produced using fossil fuel would require the equivalent of 7 continental U.S. sized land masses!\n\nSet aside the sheer scale of maintaining First World living standards using renewable energy sources. Turbines and solar installations have a relatively short service life of about 25 years. Meanwhile, China will continue to make use of fossil fuel to manufacturer most of the lithium batteries, solar and similar for a green energy transition \\*and replacement\\* of that technology as it wears out. (China has been on a worldwide buying spree the past \\~15 years buying up rare earth mineral mining sites so there\'s really no competing with China on this front.) To help the West singlehandedly fight climate crisis, China must exempt themselves from C02 emissions limits, and are reportedly still building up to 10 coal power plants per day to scale up manufacturing capacity to meet the steep energy demands of the West\'s demands for alternative energy technologies.\n\nHere in the U.S., the conversion from gas to electric (cars, appliances, etc.) will come at the price of more fossil fuel demands on our existing power grid, not less. That\'s \\*why\\* Biden keeps on signing oil/gas drilling leases and \\*why\\* we don\'t see gas/oil executives on TV wringing their hands about being put out of business.. Grid operators have warned that our current infrastructure, which on average is 60 years old, isn\'t prepared for this. So if one wanted to maintain a First World standard of living, the first priority of business might be to improve the resilience and capacity of our aging power grid. And yet with the Biden administration, it\'s the electric ""cart"" in front of the horse. If the rate at which Americans adopt (or are forced by law) to convert to all-electric outpaces the rate at which our grid is using alternative energy sources and has itself completed the transition, the results will be untold amount of disaster — as in food shortages, economic collapse and possible invasion at that point by Russia, China and their buddies in North Korea and Iran. In the name of climate change, we are literally rewriting the geopolitical map in such a way that the United States will not be able to fight an all-electric war to stop anyone who wanted to take advantage of us as we go through a rough, decades-long ""transition"".\n\nThe reality is that alternative energy cannot be used to any heavy extent in manufacturing economies such as China and India — the two countries that disproportionately account for the fact that we have 8B people on this planet and counting. (By contrast, Western countries, Japan and others have had ""negative"" birthrates and are not replacing themselves, hence the tolerance among Western countries for a perpetual state of migrant crisis, but that\'s another topic for another day.) We can HOPE countries such as China and India reduce their C02 emissions, but realistically they can\'t because we here in the West are busy inventing new markets/infrastructure built around the electrification of everything — therefore retooling our entire way of life is itself (ironically) a driver of more C02 emissions!\n\nThree groups that cannot reasonably be expected to reduce fossil fuel dependence are farmers (harvesting combines run on diesel), cargo container ship operators (to meet growing Western demands for solar, wind, EV batteries and the like, most of which will be imported from China, there will be more cargo ships in operation, not less) and the military. If you want to eat — and don\'t want to spend more and more every year on groceries to pull that off — you WANT farmers to be able to afford fuel and fertilizer, which are fossil fuel dependent. (I will acknowledge that there are a lot of downsides to factory farming but without it, feeding 8B people is going to be impossible and people routinely starving in poor countries and going broke in ""wealthy"" countries trying to keep up with inflation will be the price of rejecting modern farming practices.) As for the military there are efforts to reduce fossil fuel dependence there too — electric tanks are one of the proposals — but just the same the military will always be to a great extent fossil fuel dependent. For this reason, anyone who cares about climate crisis should also be opposed to war because war is a huge consumer of fossil fuel — the national strategic oil reserve that Biden has been accused of depleting is an acknowledgment of this dependence — but beyond the climate ramifications, Americans can\'t afford to keep funding other people\'s war efforts forever!\n\nFor all the talk of ""ending"" fossil fuel dependence, there is no path to do that to the degree necessary to ""stop"" more than a fraction of that 1.5C of global warming that Biden mentions. We are going to fundamentally upend our lives and that of our children and grandkids for the foreseeable future to make sacrifices that amount to too little, too late. The only thing guaranteed to happen, however, is that a new class of ""climate billionaires"" will end up making a killing as governments in Western countries mandate that consumers buy/upgrade to ""climate friendly"" technologies. Do they really believe that they are saving the planet? Or just willing to get rich — and to consolidate their power — trying?', 'Wow! Nuclear war will kill 360 million people in the short term from blast, burns, and radiation; plus another couple of billion over the first couple of years due to nuclear famine... 1.5 degrees will not kill anywhere that many that fast...', 'Centrist democrats love to talk big and then do very little', '[deleted]', 'Wont a nuclear war cause a ‘nuclear winter’?   Hmmmm', 'Nuclear war might actually help combat climate change. In addition to reducing the global population drastically, nuclear winter could just outright cancel out global warming.\n\nScientists are already looking into the possibility of creating artificial clouds to block out the sun in order to slow down global warming. Right now they’ve already confirmed that large amount of smogs and volcanic ashes did cool down the globe in the past. Now it’s just a matter of figuring out how to do a controlled release of engineered clouds.']

International nuclear tensions have become a talking point over the past couple of weeks as Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine shows no signs of stopping.
Amid the discourse there has been mention of the global cooling effect that a small nuclear war might have.
But does the science support this controversial narrative?
The Claim
On October 6, popular science and engineering Twitter account World of Engineering, which has around 2.4 million followers, tweeted that a small nuclear war would have the following effect: ""Smoke from the incinerated cities rises high into the atmosphere, wrapping the planet in a blanket of soot that blocks the Sun's rays.
""Lower global temperatures 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit (1.26 degrees Celsius) for 2 to 3 years following war. In more tropical areas temperatures could fall from 5.4 to 7.2 degrees F (3 to 4 degrees C)."" The thread gained over 1,000 likes.
How a small nuclear war would transform the entire planet:1/6 Smoke from the incinerated cities rises high into the atmosphere, wrapping the planet in a blanket of soot that blocks the Sun’s rays.__
Shortly afterwards, a video of Donald Trump Jr., son of former U.S. president Donald Trump, was posted to Twitter by former federal prosecutor Ron Filipkowski. In it, Trump Jr. is talking to camera on the topic of nuclear war and claims he read a news article last week about how ""a small nuclear war … could be good for global warming or the climate crisis"".
Junior tonight says he read somewhere that Leftists want a nuclear war because it will help solve global warming. pic.twitter.com/V02OaLgozc
Trump Jr. did not offer specific references to the article or study that he alleges made such a claim.
Newsweek has reached out to Donald Trump Jr. and the World of Engineering account for comments.
The Facts
To unpick some of these narratives, it is worth noting first of all that the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" are not interchangeable, and the former has been phased out by scientific consensus in favor of the latter, which is deemed to be more accurate and comprehensive descriptor of the seismic shifts occurring in the planet's weather and temperature patterns.
Newsweek Fact Check looked at the scientific consensus on the subject, assessing whether there is any research that would support the underlying claim.
There is ample evidence to suggest that a nuclear war would have a temporary global cooling effect (at least on land), but this is not the same as solving either global warming or the climate crisis more widely.
A study published in the journal Nature Food in August this year by researchers from multiple institutions around the world suggested that a nuclear war would eject large amounts of soot into the upper atmosphere, which would spread globally and ""rapidly cool the planet.""
The severity of this effect would depend on the size of the nuclear war. The study uses a hypothetical example of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, positing that such a development could eject 5 to 47 Tg of soot into the stratosphere, while a larger hypothetical nuclear war between the U.S., its allies, and Russia could produce more than 150 Tg of soot.
Alan Robock is a distinguished professor of climate science in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University and one of the co-authors of the study. He told Newsweek the estimate of 2.25 degrees F for 2 to 3 years put forward by World of Engineering was ""wrong"" and that the climate effects ""depend completely on how much smoke there would be.""
Regarding how long these effects would last, he added: ""The length of time for the effects does not depend on the amount of smoke. For all the scenarios, there will be a five-year period of maximum effects.""
Robock said the reason that a nuclear war would reduce temperatures is because the soot would rise high enough into the atmosphere that there would be no rain to wash it out. The soot would then absorb sunlight making the Earth's surface dark and cold.
Since these effects would be temporary, it is not correct to say that this would solve global warming.
Notably, whether accurate or not, the thread by World of Engineering does not suggest that the predicted drop in global temperatures would be in any way beneficial to humanity, and instead warns of dire consequences of such an event.
Indeed, when looked at in the wider context of climate change, a nuclear war would actually make things much worse by causing a whole new climate crisis.
""One factor we have not studied in depth yet is the impacts of enhanced ultraviolet (UV) light on crops, humans, and ecosystems,"" Robock said. ""Ozone in the stratosphere would be destroyed by the heating, and that would allow more ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach the surface. For the large stratospheric smoke loading, the smoke would absorb the excess UV for several years before its effects would be felt at the surface, but for the lowest amount of smoke, the effects would be felt immediately.
""Of course, the changed temperature, precipitation and sunlight would also affect ecosystems, and that deserves more study. It would not be good, but nobody has quantified the effects yet.""
The August study by Robock and colleagues stated that the climate disruption from a nuclear war, including rapid cooling, would impact global food production systems on land and in the oceans and be ""a global catastrophe for food security.""
For example, severe crop declines in major exporting countries like the U.S. and Russia would trigger export restrictions and affect import-dependent countries.
These climate effects could contribute to more than 2 billion deaths globally in the case of a war between India and Pakistan and more than 5 billion deaths globally in the case of a war between the U.S. and Russia, the study states.
Other studies also point to potential indirect impacts of this type of conflict, such as immense damage to the oceans, which are likely to lead to further negative—and less predictable—consequences for the planet.
The Ruling
False.
While it is true that even a small nuclear war could have a global cooling effect, it is not correct to say that this would solve the climate crisis.
This is partly because the cooling effects would be temporary, and partly because a nuclear winter would be a climate crisis in and of itself, causing global food shortages and potentially billions of deaths.

Every Democrat in Washington supported that, and not a single Republican did.\n\nIf you care about the future, r/VoteDEM."", 'Is it? I’m sorry but laying waste to a planet that will absolutely take 10000 years before the half life will allow the land to be habitable while we can adjust how we take care of the planet but refuse too….all for corporate greed.

Yet he speaks nothing of its contribution to the current hell we're all living through.\n\nThese American politicians love to both sides issues when they are mostly at fault.\n\nWhy the Pentagon Is the World’s Biggest Single Greenhouse Gas Emitter\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/environment/2022/10/pentagon-climate-change-neta-crawford-book/#:~:text=The%20US%20military%20is%20the,the%20emissions%20of%20most%20countries"", 'Then, shut down oil drilling?', ""my brother in christ you're literally the president"", 'If fossil fuels are so bad that nuclear war is preferable to 1.5C of warming over a 20-year period, then we also have to accept something else: The way we grew up is not going to be the way our kids or grandkids grow up. Not even close.\n\nFact checkers have attempted to downplay reports that gas stoves will be banned along with gas home heating (oil, LPG), etc. But if our leaders feel that nuclear war is preferable to climate change, then electric appliances and home heating must also be preferable to gas, so it follows that the laws will change to reflect this. (The world\'s top chefs better retrain for induction cooktops!)\n\nIt won\'t be long before there is no new home construction in which gas hookups are permitted. Is the natural gas industry and all those people they employ reading the writing on the wall on this? If not, how come we don\'t see oil and gas executives going on Fox News every other day to cry about how their industries are about to die? Well, I might have a theory on that:\n\nThe Biden administration effort to implement the Green New Deal (aka Inflation Reduction Act) might make a certain amount of sense if A) nuclear energy was the proposed substitute or B) some other life-changing technological breakthrough had occurred. But climate emergency proponents don\'t want nuclear energy either. So basically it comes down to wind and solar on a scale necessary to duplicate 2023 levels of energy consumption in the United States. I have seen estimates that replacing what is currently produced using fossil fuel would require the equivalent of 7 continental U.S. sized land masses!\n\nSet aside the sheer scale of maintaining First World living standards using renewable energy sources. Turbines and solar installations have a relatively short service life of about 25 years. Meanwhile, China will continue to make use of fossil fuel to manufacturer most of the lithium batteries, solar and similar for a green energy transition \\*and replacement\\* of that technology as it wears out. (China has been on a worldwide buying spree the past \\~15 years buying up rare earth mineral mining sites so there\'s really no competing with China on this front.) To help the West singlehandedly fight climate crisis, China must exempt themselves from C02 emissions limits, and are reportedly still building up to 10 coal power plants per day to scale up manufacturing capacity to meet the steep energy demands of the West\'s demands for alternative energy technologies.\n\nHere in the U.S., the conversion from gas to electric (cars, appliances, etc.) will come at the price of more fossil fuel demands on our existing power grid, not less. That\'s \\*why\\* Biden keeps on signing oil/gas drilling leases and \\*why\\* we don\'t see gas/oil executives on TV wringing their hands about being put out of business.. Grid operators have warned that our current infrastructure, which on average is 60 years old, isn\'t prepared for this. So if one wanted to maintain a First World standard of living, the first priority of business might be to improve the resilience and capacity of our aging power grid. And yet with the Biden administration, it\'s the electric ""cart"" in front of the horse. If the rate at which Americans adopt (or are forced by law) to convert to all-electric outpaces the rate at which our grid is using alternative energy sources and has itself completed the transition, the results will be untold amount of disaster — as in food shortages, economic collapse and possible invasion at that point by Russia, China and their buddies in North Korea and Iran. In the name of climate change, we are literally rewriting the geopolitical map in such a way that the United States will not be able to fight an all-electric war to stop anyone who wanted to take advantage of us as we go through a rough, decades-long ""transition"".\n\nThe reality is that alternative energy cannot be used to any heavy extent in manufacturing economies such as China and India — the two countries that disproportionately account for the fact that we have 8B people on this planet and counting. (By contrast, Western countries, Japan and others have had ""negative"" birthrates and are not replacing themselves, hence the tolerance among Western countries for a perpetual state of migrant crisis, but that\'s another topic for another day.) We can HOPE countries such as China and India reduce their C02 emissions, but realistically they can\'t because we here in the West are busy inventing new markets/infrastructure built around the electrification of everything — therefore retooling our entire way of life is itself (ironically) a driver of more C02 emissions!\n\nThree groups that cannot reasonably be expected to reduce fossil fuel dependence are farmers (harvesting combines run on diesel), cargo container ship operators (to meet growing Western demands for solar, wind, EV batteries and the like, most of which will be imported from China, there will be more cargo ships in operation, not less) and the military. If you want to eat — and don\'t want to spend more and more every year on groceries to pull that off — you WANT farmers to be able to afford fuel and fertilizer, which are fossil fuel dependent. (I will acknowledge that there are a lot of downsides to factory farming but without it, feeding 8B people is going to be impossible and people routinely starving in poor countries and going broke in ""wealthy"" countries trying to keep up with inflation will be the price of rejecting modern farming practices.) As for the military there are efforts to reduce fossil fuel dependence there too — electric tanks are one of the proposals — but just the same the military will always be to a great extent fossil fuel dependent. For this reason, anyone who cares about climate crisis should also be opposed to war because war is a huge consumer of fossil fuel — the national strategic oil reserve that Biden has been accused of depleting is an acknowledgment of this dependence — but beyond the climate ramifications, Americans can\'t afford to keep funding other people\'s war efforts forever!\n\nFor all the talk of ""ending"" fossil fuel dependence, there is no path to do that to the degree necessary to ""stop"" more than a fraction of that 1.5C of global warming that Biden mentions. We are going to fundamentally upend our lives and that of our children and grandkids for the foreseeable future to make sacrifices that amount to too little, too late. The only thing guaranteed to happen, however, is that a new class of ""climate billionaires"" will end up making a killing as governments in Western countries mandate that consumers buy/upgrade to ""climate friendly"" technologies. Do they really believe that they are saving the planet? Or just willing to get rich — and to consolidate their power — trying?', 'Wow! Nuclear war will kill 360 million people in the short term from blast, burns, and radiation; plus another couple of billion over the first couple of years due to nuclear famine... 1.5 degrees will not kill anywhere that many that fast...', 'Centrist democrats love to talk big and then do very little', '[deleted]', 'Wont a nuclear war cause a ‘nuclear winter’?

The study uses a hypothetical example of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, positing that such a development could eject 5 to 47 Tg of soot into the stratosphere, while a larger hypothetical nuclear war between the U.S., its allies, and Russia could produce more than 150 Tg of soot.\nAlan Robock is a distinguished professor of climate science in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University and one of the co-authors of the study. He told Newsweek the estimate of 2.25 degrees F for 2 to 3 years put forward by World of Engineering was ""wrong"" and that the climate effects ""depend completely on how much smoke there would be.""\nRegarding how long these effects would last, he added: ""The length of time for the effects does not depend on the amount of smoke. For all the scenarios, there will be a five-year period of maximum effects.""\nRobock said the reason that a nuclear war would reduce temperatures is because the soot would rise high enough into the atmosphere that there would be no rain to wash it out. The soot would then absorb sunlight making the Earth\'s surface dark and cold.\nSince these effects would be temporary, it is not correct to say that this would solve global warming.\nNotably, whether accurate or not, the thread by World of Engineering does not suggest that the predicted drop in global temperatures would be in any way beneficial to humanity, and instead warns of dire consequences of such an event.\nIndeed, when looked at in the wider context of climate change, a nuclear war would actually make things much worse by causing a whole new climate crisis.\n""One factor we have not studied in depth yet is the impacts of enhanced ultraviolet (UV) light on crops, humans, and ecosystems,"" Robock said. ""Ozone in the stratosphere would be destroyed by the heating, and that would allow more ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach the surface. For the large stratospheric smoke loading, the smoke would absorb the excess UV for several years before its effects would be felt at the surface, but for the lowest amount of smoke, the effects would be felt immediately.\n""Of course, the changed temperature, precipitation and sunlight would also affect ecosystems, and that deserves more study. It would not be good, but nobody has quantified the effects yet.""\nThe August study by Robock and colleagues stated that the climate disruption from a nuclear war, including rapid cooling, would impact global food production systems on land and in the oceans and be ""a global catastrophe for food security.""\nFor example, severe crop declines in major exporting countries like the U.S. and Russia would trigger export restrictions and affect import-dependent countries.\nThese climate effects could contribute to more than 2 billion deaths globally in the case of a war between India and Pakistan and more than 5 billion deaths globally in the case of a war between the U.S. and Russia, the study states.\nOther studies also point to potential indirect impacts of this type of conflict, such as immense damage to the oceans, which are likely to lead to further negative—and less predictable—consequences for the planet.\nThe Ruling\nFalse.\nWhile it is true that even a small nuclear war could have a global cooling effect, it is not correct to say that this would solve the climate crisis.\nThis is partly because the cooling effects would be temporary, and partly because a nuclear winter would be a climate crisis in and of itself, causing global food shortages and potentially billions of deaths.\nFACT CHECK BY NEWSWEEK\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTo End the War In Gaza, Pressure Hamas\' Sponsors, Not Israel | Opinion\n\nNetanyahu\'s Lust for Power Is Getting Israeli Hostages Killed | Opinion\n\nTop stories\n\nDonald Trump Blasts Dick Cheney as Family Backs Kamala Harris\n\nRFK Jr. May Have Just Handed Donald Trump a Boost in Two Swing States\n\nEthan Crumbley Prosecutor Compares Case to Colt Gray: \'Eerily Similar\'\n\nDonald Trump Sentencing Could Have Helped His Election Odds: Karl Rove\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\nCompany\nEditions:\nContact\nTerms of Use\n© 2024 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC\n'}]","{'tone': 'Serious', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'summary': 'The comments express concern about the potential consequences of climate change and nuclear war, questioning the prioritization of addressing these issues and the effectiveness of current political actions and policies.'}","['Regarding the potential consequences of climate change and nuclear war, I understand the concerns expressed.

Abstract
The climate crisis is one of the most important global problems facing humanity. Analyzing the search for information on climate change (CC) on the internet can be a predictor of public interest in this problem and, therefore, of the degree of concern exhibited by citizens. This study analyzes the interest in CC among the Spanish population and identifies some variables that may influence this interest. The methodology involves the collection and analysis of data obtained from SEMrush and Google Analytics. We analyzed the search trends of four key descriptors related to CC (â€œclimate change,â€ â€œglobal warming,â€ â€œclimate emergencyâ€ and â€œgreenhouse effectâ€) during two periods of time, and the relationship between these searches and three relational variables (volume of news in the media, occurrence of extreme weather events and CC-related events). The results indicate that the Spanish populationâ€™s interest in CC via the Internet has increased in recent years and is directly influenced by variables such as media coverage of CC, events related to CC, and social pressure exerted by social movements for CC. Some proposals are discussed and presented in relation to the concern for this problem.

Introduction
The scientific evidence on climate change (CC) and its consequences has been highlighted in numerous reports released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2018, 2019a, 2019b, 2023). The subject has also been debated and discussed in different international forums (Conferences of Parties, COP), with the Paris Agreement of 2015 being the greatest milestone in terms of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and fighting CC worldwide. This international treaty is legally binding, and the members, after its ratification, had to propose different strategies, plans, programs, and regulations through which they would limit global warming to 1.5â€‰Â°C based on preindustrial levels (United Nations, 2015).
For the achievement of the proposed goal, public pressure is essential (Phillis et al., 2013). Bold decisions that the climate situation requires are difficult to assume without a citizenry aware of the consequences of not making such decisions. Hence, it is of great importance to explore the interest of the population in environmental issues in general and the climate crisis in particular. In this sense, there have been recent investigations that address these issues: Eurobarometer (European Commission, 2019, 2020, 2021), reports released by the Pew Research Center (Pousther and Huang, 2019; Tyson and Kennedy, 2020; Tyson et al., 2021) and studies by the Yale Program on Climate Change (Leiserowitz et al., 2021a, 2021b). These surveys established, among other things, that in 2021, a 18% of European citizens positioned CC as â€œthe single most serious problem facing the worldâ€ just ahead of other problems commonly reported by citizens, such as poverty, hunger, and lack of clean water (17%) or the spread of infectious diseases (17%) (European Commission, 2021) and that 64% of the American population believe that reducing the effects of CC should be a â€œtop priority to ensure a sustainable planet for future generations, even if that means fewer resources for addressing other important problems todayâ€ (Tyson et al., 2021).
To understand public opinion and the informative interests of citizens regarding CC approaches such as the analysis of data derived from information searches on the subject on the internet have been used. These data are primary indications of the interests, opinions, and doubts of the population about CC. This approach is particularly relevant because, for nearly half of the European population, the Internet and social networks are the main sources of information regarding the environment (European Commission, 2020).
Studies based on metrics derived from internet searches have become an effective approach to track citizen interest in various topics, being, in some cases, even more useful than traditional surveys (Ripberger, 2011; Vosen and Schmidt, 2011). Google Trends has become the most used tool for this type of approach (Vosen and Schmidt 2011; Mellon, 2014), whose advantages include access to a large sample at a low cost, guaranteed anonymity, and analyses of long periods of time (Zhu et al., 2012; Mellon, 2014, OrduÃ±a-Malea and Aguillo, 2015).
Some researchers have used Google Trends to understand the interest of the population in issues related to biodiversity conservation (Ficetola, 2013; McCallum and Bury, 2013, Proulx et al., 2014; Burivalova et al., 2018; Zieger and Springer, 2021; Nghiem et al., 2016) and various aspects of CC. An increase in internet searches on the subject coinciding with international COP climate meetings and their media coverage has been reported (Hartwell et al., 2020). Likewise, the positive influence of various celebrities (Leonardo Di Caprio, for example), documentaries on CC (Before the Flood, for example), and the climatic protests of the student movement Fridays for the future (Mavrodieva et al., 2019) on public interest in the issue has also been analyzed and described. Other studies suggest that extreme weather events also have a positive effect on internet search behavior in relation to CC (Lang, 2014; Lang and Ryder, 2016). Signs of concern shown by elites, media coverage and, to a lesser extent, public access to accurate scientific information are also influential factors related to public concern regarding CC (Brulle et al., 2012).
This study addresses the issue of public interest in the CC phenomenon, so as to provide evidence regarding the interest about this issue among the Spanish population. The objectives of this study are as follows:
1. Identify, analyze, and classify the descriptors used in organic searches on the internet conducted in Spain about CC between April 2020 and March 2021;
2. Analyze the volume of activity and internet search trends for descriptors related to CC in Spain between April 2020 and March 2021;
3. Compare search trends for and interest in CC in Spain for the period between April 2016 and March 2021; and
4. Analyze the relationship between public interest on issues related to CC in Spain and various variables: (a) volume of news on the subject in the media; (b) extreme weather events; and (c) CC-related events of great importance (for example, world summits on climate, demonstrations, and strikes).
This work focuses on the Spanish context, and the proposed objectives are more relevant if one takes into account that in 2019 the public debate on CC was especially prolific in Spain. Climate-related student movements (Youth for ClimateFootnote 1) and homologous movements among teachers (Teachers for Future EspaÃ±aFootnote 2) and among mothers (Mothers by climateFootnote 3) put the climate emergency at the center of the debate and probably accelerated the promulgation of climate emergency declarations in some of the Autonomous Communities (regions in which Spain is administratively divided) as well as at the national level. In all cases, these are government commitment agreements for the design of actions to address the climate crisis. Furthermore, the celebration of COP25 in Madrid between December 2 and 13, 2019, could have increased the interest in CC among citizens. Additionally, in some Autonomous Communities, this debate has already been initiated with the development of regional climate laws (for example, the law of Catalonia or the Balearic Islands), and the process to approve a state law on CC and energy transition has also begun.
In 2019, the vast majority of the Spanish population (89%) considered CC to be a â€œvery seriousâ€ problem, an increase of three percentage points compared with that in 2017 (European Commission, 2019). Material damage and economic losses caused by extreme weather events (in Spain, the storms Odette or Filomena and the storm Gloria) could influence this perception. Similarly, phenomena such as increases in episodes of high temperatures or heat waves, which cause more deaths in Spain than other natural disasters, could also influence the phenomenon (Government of Spain, 2021). More recent data (Ideara, 2021) indicate that 93.5% of the Spanish population considers CC to be real and that 73.3% believe that CC is being given less importance than needed. In fact, this concern, due to the low importance given to it, has increased by 16.1 percentage points since 2012 (Meira et al., 2013).
As previously shown, the search for information on CC on the internet is a predictor of public interest in this problem and, therefore, of the degree of concern of the public. An analysis that focuses on internet searches on CC in Spain was found in one study (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes, 2015). Other studies adopted an approach that focuses more on assessing the quality of the information disseminated by the media than on considering the interest that the population may have in seeking information on this problem (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes and Mancinas-ChÃ¡vez, 2013; PÃ©rez and Perales, 2018). In this context, identifying interest in CC as well as the variables that may influence it can improve the level of knowledge and evidence regarding the degree of awareness of CC among the Spanish population. In addition, it could also provide guidance on how the effectiveness of proposed actions to raise awareness can be improved. Additionally, an increase in citizen concern for CC would entail greater social pressure, which could influence political actors. To this end, authors such as MilÃ©Å™ and SlÃ¡dek (2011), point to the importance of basic climate literacy to drive this engagement and public pressure, so that policies for climate action can be developed. This literacy aims to understand climate science in order to make informed decisions that improve our quality of life (Dupigny-Giroux, 2010) and aim to help the public better understand the climate system (Damico et al., 2018).
Method
This study involves the collection and analysis of two sets of data from searches carried out on the internet in Spain on CC. First, the â€œKeyword magic toolâ€ function of SEMrush was used to generate, from keywords and descriptors, a list of related keywords used for organic searches in Google. SEMrush is an online marketing and visibility analysis tool that uses Google Analytics data and allows examining, among other aspects, the grouping, management, and traffic generated by keywords. Following a previous study by Nanda et al. (2021) these keywords are the search terms used as a search engine in Google and are then used to list websites in the results pages that are returned. Data analysis is based on the Google search engine which is more precise and has better quality than any other search engine (Kostagiolas et al., 2021). From SEMrush we used the following features: (1) Keyword Search Volume: the average number of monthly searches of a particular keyword over 12 months and (2) Keyword Trend: the level of interest in a search query over 12 months.
For this study, an initial search of concepts related to CC was applied, considering the keywords â€œclimate change,â€ â€œglobal warming,â€ â€œclimate emergencyâ€ and â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ Notably, the terms â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ and â€œclimate changeâ€ are not scientifically synonymous because the greenhouse effect is a phenomenon that occurs naturally in the atmosphere; an increase in the greenhouse effect is the cause of global warming, and the consequence is CC. However, they are terms that are used interchangeably by the media and the general public when referring to this problem (Caballero et al., 2007). These misconceptions were already identified among citizens in the 1990s (Kempton, 1991; LÃ¶fstedt, 1991) and persist nowadays (Leiserowitz et al., 2010; Crosman et al., 2019). Unfortunately, are part of the common heritage of CC.
Thus, the consideration and inclusion of â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ among the terms analyzed are relevant for this study. From these initial searches, a first list of 55,280 keywords was obtained for searches carried out in Spain on CC. Given the large volume of keywords located in the first search, something intrinsic to this methodological approach as stated by Lillo and Ruggieri (2021) is the impossibility of counting all queries, especially when dealing with a long distribution queue; therefore, to set up a cut-off point only the terms that had monthly organic search averages equal to or >100 were considered. This cut-off point is quite significant as represents 87% of the total searches performed in Spain for the keywords considered during the period analyzed. The four keyword lists with 100 or more monthly searches were downloaded as a single search. An Excel spreadsheet was created with the following data from SEMrush using the â€œKeyword magic toolâ€ option: (1) monthly volume of searches in Google for each keyword (provides the average monthly searches using a given keyword in a 12-month period, in our case from April 2020 to March 2021); and (2) trend data that measure the interest in a specified keyword during a 12-month period (the metric is based on the changes in the number of queries per month).
Once all the keywords were downloaded in a single data matrix in Excel, the descriptors that were duplicates and keywords that had no relationship with the organic searches clearly associated with CC were eliminated (for example, â€œTrump climate changeâ€, â€œclimate change girlâ€, â€œBill Gates climate changeâ€, and â€œpolar bear global warmingâ€). The final list of 200 keywords comprised the final sample for the first dataset of the study. All 200 keywords were classified into categories based on the purpose of the search. To do so, one of the authors analyzed the 200 terms and generated initially six categories with them and submitted this to the rest of the authors that had to review the initial clustering generated. After a triangulation process, the other authors generated two new categories and a consensus was achieved and a set of 8 categories were generated to classify the sample constituted by the 200 keywords.
To develop the second dataset, metrics from Google Trends on search trends in the search engine were obtained; these data illustrate how often a search for a particular term is performed in various regions and countries of the world and in several languages. Google Trends helps to detect moments when the popularity of a term increases and provides the average value of the relative interest in a selected time range. In this phase of data collection, the terms â€œclimate changeâ€, â€œglobal warmingâ€, â€œclimate emergencyâ€ and â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ were again applied for the period between April 2016 and March 2021 (both inclusive). For each term, the data for the weekly trends were downloaded for the entire period analyzed. The values were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 indicated the week with the highest frequency of searches in proportion to the total number of queries; 50 and 0 indicated the weeks where the popularity of the term was half in relation to the maximum value or in which there were not enough data for the calculation, respectively.
For this study, we also obtained information on a series of variables related to the searches to find potential associations between variables. Thus, the following were considered: (a) the volume of news in the media between April 2016 and March 2021 (for this variable, the data related to the daily number of news stories appearing in RTVE newscasts and the Spanish public television and radio station, using the Civio search engine https://verba.civio.es, were considered), from which two values were established, i.e., (1) weeks during which the number of news items on CC was below the total average and (2) weeks during which the number of news items on CC was above the total average; (b) extreme meteorological phenomena that occurred weekly between April 2016 and March 2021; these data were obtained from monthly reports released by the Annual Climatological Summary of the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET, in Spanish) from 2016 to 2020 and for the year 2021 (https://bit.ly/3g0JmgE); (c) events of great importance on CC between April 2016 and March 2021, such as world summits on CC and COPs promoted annually by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC https://bit.ly/3fPVOQc) and climate-related demonstrations and strikes promoted by the student movement Fridays for Futureâ€”EspaÃ±a (https://juventudxclima.es/); and (d) reports by the IPCC (https://www.ipcc.ch/reports).
Data processing and analysis
Data processing and analysis were carried out using the statistical analysis program SPSS V.22, and the following statistics were used: frequency analysis, Studentâ€™s t-test to compare means, and one-way ANOVA.
Results
Keywords used to search for information related to CC and search volume in a 12-month period
In relation to the first of the objectives of this research (Identify, analyze, and classify the descriptors used in organic searches about CC between April 2020 and March 2021), from the list of 200 keywords generated with SEMrush, monthly search volumes averages varied among the 33,100 organic searches for the keyword â€œclimate changeâ€ (see Table 1, which presents the 20 keywords with the most monthly searches, on average), and 100 searches that accumulated 110 of the keywords (the analysis limit an average equal to or >100 monthly searches for the period between April 2020 and March 2021). The total volume of monthly searches for the 200 analyzed terms was 146,830 searches. These data, converted to an annual average, indicate that during the period considered, more than 1,750,000 searches were carried out in Spain with the 200 descriptors analyzed. As seen (Table 1), the terms â€œclimate changeâ€, â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ and â€œglobal warmingâ€ had the highest search frequency throughout the year, with greater relevance of the term â€œclimate changeâ€ among these first 20 keywords. However, the term â€œclimate emergencyâ€ is also relevant, occupying position 11 in the ranking.
The 200 keywords were coded into eight categories, classified, and counted based on the types of searches performed. As seen in Fig. 1, the greatest volume of searches was focused on locating general information about CC (for example, â€œwhat is climate changeâ€, â€œclimate change definitionâ€, â€œclimate change in Spainâ€, and â€œglobal warming definitionâ€). Second were searches aimed at finding news and resources, using terms such as â€œglobal warming news,â€ â€œclimate change for children,â€ and â€œimages of climate changeâ€. Third (with very even figures) were searches for the causes and consequences of CC. The categories that generated a lower volume of searches were denialism (for example, â€œclimate change does not existâ€ or â€œclimate change denialâ€) and events related to the topic of interest (for example, â€œInternational Climate Change Dayâ€, â€œclimate change protestâ€, and â€œclimate change summitâ€). The category legislation, strategies, and plans were relevant among these searches in the last year because of the interest in the Spanish CC law (in fact, most of the search terms of this category correspond to â€œclimate change lawâ€).
Please note that eight search categories were determined.
Monthly search trends across a 12-month period
Regarding the second research objective (Analyze the volume of activity and internet search trends for descriptors related to CC between April 2020 and March 2021), SEMrush provides metrics that measure trends in searches using each keyword based on the changes in the number of queries per month. The values range from 0 to 1, which we multiplied by 100. This parameter allowed establishing the monthly trends for searches using the categorized keywords in Spain for the 12 months analyzed (see Fig. 2). April, June, and November 2020 were the months with the highest search trends for the set of keywords analyzed, and the lowest trends occurred in August and September of that same year.
Please note that the data legend in certain values of the categories highlights the variations in the searches. Dates of important events have also been highlighted in boxes.
Variations in the level of interest in certain organic searches can be noted. For example, in April 2020, Solutions (90.3 points), News and Resources (87.35 points), Generic Searches (82.5 points), and Consequences (82.11 points) were popular categories. Subsequently, in May 2020, there was an increase of ~52 points in interest in the Legislation, Strategies, and Plans category (from 34.09 points on May 20 to 86.64 points on June 20). On May 19, 2020, the draft law for CC and energy transition in Spain was approved by the Council of Ministers. There was also a considerable increase in interest in the events category in October 2020, with an ~69-point difference between October (15.8) and November (84.7). On October 24, 2020, the International Day against CC was celebrated. It is striking that the interest related to the International Day against CC and the searches related to Denialism exhibited parallel increases (from ~16 points in October to 84.7 and 88.3 in November for Events and Denialism, respectively). Between January and February of 2021, there was also an increase in interest in Denialism, but not as substantial as that observed in October 2020.
Annual search trends across the 5-year period
To achieve the third objective, focused on comparing the search trends for CC in Spain between April 2016 and March 2021, one-way ANOVA was performed. The existence of significant differences in the annual means of search interest in the four keywords was calculated using data from Google Trends (see Table 2). The results indicated that there were statistically significant differences in the interest in CC in the 5-year period for the keywords â€œclimate changeâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œglobal warmingâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.011), and â€œclimate emergencyâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). In general, beginning in 2016, there was an annual increase in searches using the four keywords analyzed. In 2019, searches peaked, with a significant difference with respect to the other years.
Relationship between internet searches for CC and media coverage of CC between 2016 and 2021
Regarding the relationship between the volume of news appearing in RTVE newscasts on topics related to CC and internet searches for this environmental problem (the fourth objective of this study), the results obtained for the four keywords analyzed indicate that there are statistically significant differences in all cases; the greater the number of news items, the greater was the interest in searching for the concepts analyzed: â€œclimate changeâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œglobal warmingâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œclimate emergencyâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000) and â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.018) (Table 3).
Relationship between internet searches for CC and extreme meteorological phenomena that occurred between 2016 and 2021
The second of the variables studied for the fourth objective was the relationship between searches for CC and extreme meteorological phenomena, such as heat or cold waves, isolated high-level depression (DANA in its Spanish acronym), torrential rains, etc., that occurred during specific weeks in the last 5 years. That is, the aim was to analyze whether the occurrence of these phenomena influenced internet searches for CC. The statistical tests carried out indicated that there were only statistically significant differences between extreme meteorological phenomena and searches using the keyword â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.008) (Table 4).
Internet searches and CC-related events between 2016 and 2021
The last of the relationships investigated in objective four was between internet searches for CC and â€œevents.â€ This analysis included all weeks in which there was a climate demonstration or strike, a climate summit, or the release of an IPCC report. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship between CC-related events and an increase in internet searches using the keywords â€œclimate changeâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œglobal warmingâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), and â€œclimate emergencyâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.023); the association was not significant for â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.820) (Table 5).
Discussions and conclusions
The results from this study reflect the public interest in CC in Spain in recent years based on internet search trends. The data obtained allowed us to identify which words and concepts are the most used by Google users in Spain to seek information related to CC and to determine the number of searches that this problem generates, which is substantial because the average monthly number of searches between April 2020 and March 2021 was 34,750. The first noteworthy observation regarding the search trends is how interest in CC increased in the last 5 years (2016â€“2021) among the Spanish population. A trend was also observed between 2017 and 2019 in relation to concerns about CC (European Commission, 2019). The year 2019 was a milestone regarding the number of searches. This trend can be explained by the student climate movement that began worldwide in 2019, with repercussions in Spain and with two school climate strikes (March and September 2019). In addition, in 2019, the COP25 was held in Spain. However, this interest decreased with the emergence of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. This was the time of global lockdowns, which banned demonstrations and delayed summits such as COP26. What is more, COVID-19 increased the need for public information about the coronavirus (Bento et al., 2020; Vijay et al., 2021), reducing the space and interest for information on other issues. For example, compared to 2019, in 2020, there was a decrease of 23% in the appearance of news about CC in media worldwide (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes and JimÃ©nez-GÃ_mez, 2021).
The monthly search trends for 2020 and 2021 in Spain fluctuated, coinciding with various key events. For example, in May 2020, there was an increase in searches for terms in the Legislation, Strategies, and Plans category. This likely occurred because a CC and energy transition bill was approved by the Council of Ministers of Spain (May 19, 2020), generating great interest among the Spanish population. In October 2020, there was also a considerable increase in searches using terms in the Events category, probably because October 24 was the International Day against CC. What is more, this data, compared with those from the Media and Climate Change Observatoryâ€”ECCO (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes and JimÃ©nez-GÃ_mez, 2021) on media coverage of CC indicates an increase in the number of publications in the main Spanish newspapers in October and November 2020 compared to the two previous months. This fact could also explain the surge in Internet searches by the Spanish population on this event, given the positive relationship shown in this study between these searches and media coverage of the CC. Searches related to denialism peaked in some months (October and November 2020 and January and February 2021); however, this does not necessarily indicate that Spanish society doubts the existence of CC. In our study, there was a low number of organic searches using terms in this category (see Fig. 1), and the demoscopy in this sense indicated that such beliefs are residual and have gradually decreased since 2010, from 8.5 points (Meira et al., 2011) to 3.5 points (Ideara, 2021). Relationships between internet searches for CC and media coverage of CC, the occurrence of extreme weather phenomena, and CC-related events were analyzed in this study to establish statistically significant differences among the searches using the four keywords analyzed. The results obtained indicate that the increase in news stories about CC in the media implies an increase in interest by the population in information on the internet about CC, a finding also found in previous studies of written press for Spain (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes, 2015). However, it is striking, and to some extent worrisome, how this positive relationship is also established with the keyword â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ This is not an isolated fact; the confusion and interrelation between CC, the greenhouse effect, and the hole in the ozone layer are common in the existing scientific literature (Bozdogan, 2011). Thus, as stated by Meira (2007), this erroneous conceptualization has become part of the common culture, and the â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ is extensively used as a synonym for CC.
Unlike the results obtained in previous studies (Lang, 2014; Lang and Ryder, 2016), the occurrence of extreme weather events did not increase the interest of the Spanish population in CC, at least not for three of the four keywords analyzed. This trend could indicate, therefore, that the Spanish population considers these phenomena as isolated events and not as consequences of CC or as having no influence on their interest or concern for this problem. This variation in searches on CC seems to coincide, precisely, with the data reported by studies on the perception of CC in Spain: in 2019, 66.5% of the Spanish population considered that CC was being given less importance than it should (Valdor et al., 2019), and in 2020, this percentage increased by 6.5 points (Ideara, 2021). However, this argument is controversial because this relationship has been observed with searches using the keyword â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ Therefore, we understand that the erroneous relationship between CC and the greenhouse effect continues to be perpetuated throughout society.
The occurrence of CC-related events, the last of the variables analyzed in this study, influenced the interest in CC among the Spanish population, especially during weeks in which these events recur. Previous research in this regard has yielded similar results: positive associations between interest in CC and student climate movements (Mavrodieva et al., 2019) or international climate meetings (Hartwell et al., 2020; FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes, 2015). Notably, this relationship is observed for the keywords â€œclimate change,â€ â€œglobal warmingâ€ and â€œclimate emergencyâ€ but not for â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ This finding may be due not only to the use of these words during these events, underscoring the importance and gravity of the problem, but also to the fact that the language and concepts used at such events invoke a greater degree of climate literacy.
In light of the results obtained in this study, it could be concluded that the interest of the Spanish population in CC has increased on the internet in recent years and that some of the variables that may influence this interest are media coverage of CC, CC-related events and the social pressure exerted by climate-related social movements. The interest of citizens in CC could indicate the degree of social concern for this problem and even serve as a factor",Biden: ‘Nobody intelligent’ can deny the impact of climate crisis,"['I really wish his actions would fully meet his words.

Analyzing the search for information on climate change (CC) on the internet can be a predictor of public interest in this problem and, therefore, of the degree of concern exhibited by citizens. This study analyzes the interest in CC among the Spanish population and identifies some variables that may influence this interest. The methodology involves the collection and analysis of data obtained from SEMrush and Google Analytics. We analyzed the search trends of four key descriptors related to CC (â€œclimate change,â€ â€œglobal warming,â€ â€œclimate emergencyâ€ and â€œgreenhouse effectâ€) during two periods of time, and the relationship between these searches and three relational variables (volume of news in the media, occurrence of extreme weather events and CC-related events). The results indicate that the Spanish populationâ€™s interest in CC via the Internet has increased in recent years and is directly influenced by variables such as media coverage of CC, events related to CC, and social pressure exerted by social movements for CC. Some proposals are discussed and presented in relation to the concern for this problem.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of google searches\nGeographic social inequalities in information-seeking response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China: longitudinal analysis of Baidu Index\nClimate summits and protests have a strong impact on climate change media coverage in Germany\nIntroduction\nThe scientific evidence on climate change (CC) and its consequences has been highlighted in numerous reports released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2018, 2019a, 2019b, 2023). The subject has also been debated and discussed in different international forums (Conferences of Parties, COP), with the Paris Agreement of 2015 being the greatest milestone in terms of limiting greenhouse gas emissions and fighting CC worldwide. This international treaty is legally binding, and the members, after its ratification, had to propose different strategies, plans, programs, and regulations through which they would limit global warming to 1.5â€‰Â°C based on preindustrial levels (United Nations, 2015).\nFor the achievement of the proposed goal, public pressure is essential (Phillis et al., 2013). Bold decisions that the climate situation requires are difficult to assume without a citizenry aware of the consequences of not making such decisions. Hence, it is of great importance to explore the interest of the population in environmental issues in general and the climate crisis in particular. In this sense, there have been recent investigations that address these issues: Eurobarometer (European Commission, 2019, 2020, 2021), reports released by the Pew Research Center (Pousther and Huang, 2019; Tyson and Kennedy, 2020; Tyson et al., 2021) and studies by the Yale Program on Climate Change (Leiserowitz et al., 2021a, 2021b). These surveys established, among other things, that in 2021, a 18% of European citizens positioned CC as â€œthe single most serious problem facing the worldâ€ just ahead of other problems commonly reported by citizens, such as poverty, hunger, and lack of clean water (17%) or the spread of infectious diseases (17%) (European Commission, 2021) and that 64% of the American population believe that reducing the effects of CC should be a â€œtop priority to ensure a sustainable planet for future generations, even if that means fewer resources for addressing other important problems todayâ€ (Tyson et al., 2021).\nTo understand public opinion and the informative interests of citizens regarding CC approaches such as the analysis of data derived from information searches on the subject on the internet have been used. These data are primary indications of the interests, opinions, and doubts of the population about CC. This approach is particularly relevant because, for nearly half of the European population, the Internet and social networks are the main sources of information regarding the environment (European Commission, 2020).\nStudies based on metrics derived from internet searches have become an effective approach to track citizen interest in various topics, being, in some cases, even more useful than traditional surveys (Ripberger, 2011; Vosen and Schmidt, 2011). Google Trends has become the most used tool for this type of approach (Vosen and Schmidt 2011; Mellon, 2014), whose advantages include access to a large sample at a low cost, guaranteed anonymity, and analyses of long periods of time (Zhu et al., 2012; Mellon, 2014, OrduÃ±a-Malea and Aguillo, 2015).\nSome researchers have used Google Trends to understand the interest of the population in issues related to biodiversity conservation (Ficetola, 2013; McCallum and Bury, 2013, Proulx et al., 2014; Burivalova et al., 2018; Zieger and Springer, 2021; Nghiem et al., 2016) and various aspects of CC. An increase in internet searches on the subject coinciding with international COP climate meetings and their media coverage has been reported (Hartwell et al., 2020). Likewise, the positive influence of various celebrities (Leonardo Di Caprio, for example), documentaries on CC (Before the Flood, for example), and the climatic protests of the student movement Fridays for the future (Mavrodieva et al., 2019) on public interest in the issue has also been analyzed and described. Other studies suggest that extreme weather events also have a positive effect on internet search behavior in relation to CC (Lang, 2014; Lang and Ryder, 2016). Signs of concern shown by elites, media coverage and, to a lesser extent, public access to accurate scientific information are also influential factors related to public concern regarding CC (Brulle et al., 2012).\nThis study addresses the issue of public interest in the CC phenomenon, so as to provide evidence regarding the interest about this issue among the Spanish population. The objectives of this study are as follows:\n1. Identify, analyze, and classify the descriptors used in organic searches on the internet conducted in Spain about CC between April 2020 and March 2021;\n2. Analyze the volume of activity and internet search trends for descriptors related to CC in Spain between April 2020 and March 2021;\n3. Compare search trends for and interest in CC in Spain for the period between April 2016 and March 2021; and\n4. Analyze the relationship between public interest on issues related to CC in Spain and various variables: (a) volume of news on the subject in the media; (b) extreme weather events; and (c) CC-related events of great importance (for example, world summits on climate, demonstrations, and strikes).\nThis work focuses on the Spanish context, and the proposed objectives are more relevant if one takes into account that in 2019 the public debate on CC was especially prolific in Spain. Climate-related student movements (Youth for ClimateFootnote 1) and homologous movements among teachers (Teachers for Future EspaÃ±aFootnote 2) and among mothers (Mothers by climateFootnote 3) put the climate emergency at the center of the debate and probably accelerated the promulgation of climate emergency declarations in some of the Autonomous Communities (regions in which Spain is administratively divided) as well as at the national level. In all cases, these are government commitment agreements for the design of actions to address the climate crisis. Furthermore, the celebration of COP25 in Madrid between December 2 and 13, 2019, could have increased the interest in CC among citizens. Additionally, in some Autonomous Communities, this debate has already been initiated with the development of regional climate laws (for example, the law of Catalonia or the Balearic Islands), and the process to approve a state law on CC and energy transition has also begun.\nIn 2019, the vast majority of the Spanish population (89%) considered CC to be a â€œvery seriousâ€ problem, an increase of three percentage points compared with that in 2017 (European Commission, 2019). Material damage and economic losses caused by extreme weather events (in Spain, the storms Odette or Filomena and the storm Gloria) could influence this perception. Similarly, phenomena such as increases in episodes of high temperatures or heat waves, which cause more deaths in Spain than other natural disasters, could also influence the phenomenon (Government of Spain, 2021). More recent data (Ideara, 2021) indicate that 93.5% of the Spanish population considers CC to be real and that 73.3% believe that CC is being given less importance than needed. In fact, this concern, due to the low importance given to it, has increased by 16.1 percentage points since 2012 (Meira et al., 2013).\nAs previously shown, the search for information on CC on the internet is a predictor of public interest in this problem and, therefore, of the degree of concern of the public. An analysis that focuses on internet searches on CC in Spain was found in one study (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes, 2015). Other studies adopted an approach that focuses more on assessing the quality of the information disseminated by the media than on considering the interest that the population may have in seeking information on this problem (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes and Mancinas-ChÃ¡vez, 2013; PÃ©rez and Perales, 2018). In this context, identifying interest in CC as well as the variables that may influence it can improve the level of knowledge and evidence regarding the degree of awareness of CC among the Spanish population. In addition, it could also provide guidance on how the effectiveness of proposed actions to raise awareness can be improved. Additionally, an increase in citizen concern for CC would entail greater social pressure, which could influence political actors. To this end, authors such as MilÃ©Å™ and SlÃ¡dek (2011), point to the importance of basic climate literacy to drive this engagement and public pressure, so that policies for climate action can be developed. This literacy aims to understand climate science in order to make informed decisions that improve our quality of life (Dupigny-Giroux, 2010) and aim to help the public better understand the climate system (Damico et al., 2018).\nMethod\nThis study involves the collection and analysis of two sets of data from searches carried out on the internet in Spain on CC. First, the â€œKeyword magic toolâ€ function of SEMrush was used to generate, from keywords and descriptors, a list of related keywords used for organic searches in Google. SEMrush is an online marketing and visibility analysis tool that uses Google Analytics data and allows examining, among other aspects, the grouping, management, and traffic generated by keywords. Following a previous study by Nanda et al. (2021) these keywords are the search terms used as a search engine in Google and are then used to list websites in the results pages that are returned. Data analysis is based on the Google search engine which is more precise and has better quality than any other search engine (Kostagiolas et al., 2021). From SEMrush we used the following features: (1) Keyword Search Volume: the average number of monthly searches of a particular keyword over 12 months and (2) Keyword Trend: the level of interest in a search query over 12 months.\nFor this study, an initial search of concepts related to CC was applied, considering the keywords â€œclimate change,â€ â€œglobal warming,â€ â€œclimate emergencyâ€ and â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ Notably, the terms â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ and â€œclimate changeâ€ are not scientifically synonymous because the greenhouse effect is a phenomenon that occurs naturally in the atmosphere; an increase in the greenhouse effect is the cause of global warming, and the consequence is CC. However, they are terms that are used interchangeably by the media and the general public when referring to this problem (Caballero et al., 2007). These misconceptions were already identified among citizens in the 1990s (Kempton, 1991; LÃ¶fstedt, 1991) and persist nowadays (Leiserowitz et al., 2010; Crosman et al., 2019). Unfortunately, are part of the common heritage of CC.\nThus, the consideration and inclusion of â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ among the terms analyzed are relevant for this study. From these initial searches, a first list of 55,280 keywords was obtained for searches carried out in Spain on CC. Given the large volume of keywords located in the first search, something intrinsic to this methodological approach as stated by Lillo and Ruggieri (2021) is the impossibility of counting all queries, especially when dealing with a long distribution queue; therefore, to set up a cut-off point only the terms that had monthly organic search averages equal to or >100 were considered. This cut-off point is quite significant as represents 87% of the total searches performed in Spain for the keywords considered during the period analyzed. The four keyword lists with 100 or more monthly searches were downloaded as a single search. An Excel spreadsheet was created with the following data from SEMrush using the â€œKeyword magic toolâ€ option: (1) monthly volume of searches in Google for each keyword (provides the average monthly searches using a given keyword in a 12-month period, in our case from April 2020 to March 2021); and (2) trend data that measure the interest in a specified keyword during a 12-month period (the metric is based on the changes in the number of queries per month).\nOnce all the keywords were downloaded in a single data matrix in Excel, the descriptors that were duplicates and keywords that had no relationship with the organic searches clearly associated with CC were eliminated (for example, â€œTrump climate changeâ€, â€œclimate change girlâ€, â€œBill Gates climate changeâ€, and â€œpolar bear global warmingâ€). The final list of 200 keywords comprised the final sample for the first dataset of the study. All 200 keywords were classified into categories based on the purpose of the search. To do so, one of the authors analyzed the 200 terms and generated initially six categories with them and submitted this to the rest of the authors that had to review the initial clustering generated. After a triangulation process, the other authors generated two new categories and a consensus was achieved and a set of 8 categories were generated to classify the sample constituted by the 200 keywords.\nTo develop the second dataset, metrics from Google Trends on search trends in the search engine were obtained; these data illustrate how often a search for a particular term is performed in various regions and countries of the world and in several languages. Google Trends helps to detect moments when the popularity of a term increases and provides the average value of the relative interest in a selected time range. In this phase of data collection, the terms â€œclimate changeâ€, â€œglobal warmingâ€, â€œclimate emergencyâ€ and â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ were again applied for the period between April 2016 and March 2021 (both inclusive). For each term, the data for the weekly trends were downloaded for the entire period analyzed. The values were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 indicated the week with the highest frequency of searches in proportion to the total number of queries; 50 and 0 indicated the weeks where the popularity of the term was half in relation to the maximum value or in which there were not enough data for the calculation, respectively.\nFor this study, we also obtained information on a series of variables related to the searches to find potential associations between variables. Thus, the following were considered: (a) the volume of news in the media between April 2016 and March 2021 (for this variable, the data related to the daily number of news stories appearing in RTVE newscasts and the Spanish public television and radio station, using the Civio search engine https://verba.civio.es, were considered), from which two values were established, i.e., (1) weeks during which the number of news items on CC was below the total average and (2) weeks during which the number of news items on CC was above the total average; (b) extreme meteorological phenomena that occurred weekly between April 2016 and March 2021; these data were obtained from monthly reports released by the Annual Climatological Summary of the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET, in Spanish) from 2016 to 2020 and for the year 2021 (https://bit.ly/3g0JmgE); (c) events of great importance on CC between April 2016 and March 2021, such as world summits on CC and COPs promoted annually by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC https://bit.ly/3fPVOQc) and climate-related demonstrations and strikes promoted by the student movement Fridays for Futureâ€”EspaÃ±a (https://juventudxclima.es/); and (d) reports by the IPCC (https://www.ipcc.ch/reports).\nData processing and analysis\nData processing and analysis were carried out using the statistical analysis program SPSS V.22, and the following statistics were used: frequency analysis, Studentâ€™s t-test to compare means, and one-way ANOVA.\nResults\nKeywords used to search for information related to CC and search volume in a 12-month period\nIn relation to the first of the objectives of this research (Identify, analyze, and classify the descriptors used in organic searches about CC between April 2020 and March 2021), from the list of 200 keywords generated with SEMrush, monthly search volumes averages varied among the 33,100 organic searches for the keyword â€œclimate changeâ€ (see Table 1, which presents the 20 keywords with the most monthly searches, on average), and 100 searches that accumulated 110 of the keywords (the analysis limit an average equal to or >100 monthly searches for the period between April 2020 and March 2021). The total volume of monthly searches for the 200 analyzed terms was 146,830 searches. These data, converted to an annual average, indicate that during the period considered, more than 1,750,000 searches were carried out in Spain with the 200 descriptors analyzed. As seen (Table 1), the terms â€œclimate changeâ€, â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ and â€œglobal warmingâ€ had the highest search frequency throughout the year, with greater relevance of the term â€œclimate changeâ€ among these first 20 keywords. However, the term â€œclimate emergencyâ€ is also relevant, occupying position 11 in the ranking.\nThe 200 keywords were coded into eight categories, classified, and counted based on the types of searches performed. As seen in Fig. 1, the greatest volume of searches was focused on locating general information about CC (for example, â€œwhat is climate changeâ€, â€œclimate change definitionâ€, â€œclimate change in Spainâ€, and â€œglobal warming definitionâ€). Second were searches aimed at finding news and resources, using terms such as â€œglobal warming news,â€ â€œclimate change for children,â€ and â€œimages of climate changeâ€. Third (with very even figures) were searches for the causes and consequences of CC. The categories that generated a lower volume of searches were denialism (for example, â€œclimate change does not existâ€ or â€œclimate change denialâ€) and events related to the topic of interest (for example, â€œInternational Climate Change Dayâ€, â€œclimate change protestâ€, and â€œclimate change summitâ€). The category legislation, strategies, and plans were relevant among these searches in the last year because of the interest in the Spanish CC law (in fact, most of the search terms of this category correspond to â€œclimate change lawâ€).\nPlease note that eight search categories were determined.\nMonthly search trends across a 12-month period\nRegarding the second research objective (Analyze the volume of activity and internet search trends for descriptors related to CC between April 2020 and March 2021), SEMrush provides metrics that measure trends in searches using each keyword based on the changes in the number of queries per month. The values range from 0 to 1, which we multiplied by 100. This parameter allowed establishing the monthly trends for searches using the categorized keywords in Spain for the 12 months analyzed (see Fig. 2). April, June, and November 2020 were the months with the highest search trends for the set of keywords analyzed, and the lowest trends occurred in August and September of that same year.\nPlease note that the data legend in certain values of the categories highlights the variations in the searches. Dates of important events have also been highlighted in boxes.\nVariations in the level of interest in certain organic searches can be noted. For example, in April 2020, Solutions (90.3 points), News and Resources (87.35 points), Generic Searches (82.5 points), and Consequences (82.11 points) were popular categories. Subsequently, in May 2020, there was an increase of ~52 points in interest in the Legislation, Strategies, and Plans category (from 34.09 points on May 20 to 86.64 points on June 20). On May 19, 2020, the draft law for CC and energy transition in Spain was approved by the Council of Ministers. There was also a considerable increase in interest in the events category in October 2020, with an ~69-point difference between October (15.8) and November (84.7). On October 24, 2020, the International Day against CC was celebrated. It is striking that the interest related to the International Day against CC and the searches related to Denialism exhibited parallel increases (from ~16 points in October to 84.7 and 88.3 in November for Events and Denialism, respectively). Between January and February of 2021, there was also an increase in interest in Denialism, but not as substantial as that observed in October 2020.\nAnnual search trends across the 5-year period\nTo achieve the third objective, focused on comparing the search trends for CC in Spain between April 2016 and March 2021, one-way ANOVA was performed. The existence of significant differences in the annual means of search interest in the four keywords was calculated using data from Google Trends (see Table 2). The results indicated that there were statistically significant differences in the interest in CC in the 5-year period for the keywords â€œclimate changeâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œglobal warmingâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.011), and â€œclimate emergencyâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). In general, beginning in 2016, there was an annual increase in searches using the four keywords analyzed. In 2019, searches peaked, with a significant difference with respect to the other years.\nRelationship between internet searches for CC and media coverage of CC between 2016 and 2021\nRegarding the relationship between the volume of news appearing in RTVE newscasts on topics related to CC and internet searches for this environmental problem (the fourth objective of this study), the results obtained for the four keywords analyzed indicate that there are statistically significant differences in all cases; the greater the number of news items, the greater was the interest in searching for the concepts analyzed: â€œclimate changeâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œglobal warmingâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œclimate emergencyâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000) and â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.018) (Table 3).\nRelationship between internet searches for CC and extreme meteorological phenomena that occurred between 2016 and 2021\nThe second of the variables studied for the fourth objective was the relationship between searches for CC and extreme meteorological phenomena, such as heat or cold waves, isolated high-level depression (DANA in its Spanish acronym), torrential rains, etc., that occurred during specific weeks in the last 5 years. That is, the aim was to analyze whether the occurrence of these phenomena influenced internet searches for CC. The statistical tests carried out indicated that there were only statistically significant differences between extreme meteorological phenomena and searches using the keyword â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.008) (Table 4).\nInternet searches and CC-related events between 2016 and 2021\nThe last of the relationships investigated in objective four was between internet searches for CC and â€œevents.â€ This analysis included all weeks in which there was a climate demonstration or strike, a climate summit, or the release of an IPCC report. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship between CC-related events and an increase in internet searches using the keywords â€œclimate changeâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), â€œglobal warmingâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), and â€œclimate emergencyâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.023); the association was not significant for â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.820) (Table 5).\nDiscussions and conclusions\nThe results from this study reflect the public interest in CC in Spain in recent years based on internet search trends. The data obtained allowed us to identify which words and concepts are the most used by Google users in Spain to seek information related to CC and to determine the number of searches that this problem generates, which is substantial because the average monthly number of searches between April 2020 and March 2021 was 34,750. The first noteworthy observation regarding the search trends is how interest in CC increased in the last 5 years (2016â€“2021) among the Spanish population. A trend was also observed between 2017 and 2019 in relation to concerns about CC (European Commission, 2019). The year 2019 was a milestone regarding the number of searches. This trend can be explained by the student climate movement that began worldwide in 2019, with repercussions in Spain and with two school climate strikes (March and September 2019). In addition, in 2019, the COP25 was held in Spain. However, this interest decreased with the emergence of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. This was the time of global lockdowns, which banned demonstrations and delayed summits such as COP26. What is more, COVID-19 increased the need for public information about the coronavirus (Bento et al., 2020; Vijay et al., 2021), reducing the space and interest for information on other issues. For example, compared to 2019, in 2020, there was a decrease of 23% in the appearance of news about CC in media worldwide (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes and JimÃ©nez-GÃ_mez, 2021).\nThe monthly search trends for 2020 and 2021 in Spain fluctuated, coinciding with various key events. For example, in May 2020, there was an increase in searches for terms in the Legislation, Strategies, and Plans category. This likely occurred because a CC and energy transition bill was approved by the Council of Ministers of Spain (May 19, 2020), generating great interest among the Spanish population. In October 2020, there was also a considerable increase in searches using terms in the Events category, probably because October 24 was the International Day against CC. What is more, this data, compared with those from the Media and Climate Change Observatoryâ€”ECCO (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes and JimÃ©nez-GÃ_mez, 2021) on media coverage of CC indicates an increase in the number of publications in the main Spanish newspapers in October and November 2020 compared to the two previous months. This fact could also explain the surge in Internet searches by the Spanish population on this event, given the positive relationship shown in this study between these searches and media coverage of the CC. Searches related to denialism peaked in some months (October and November 2020 and January and February 2021); however, this does not necessarily indicate that Spanish society doubts the existence of CC. In our study, there was a low number of organic searches using terms in this category (see Fig. 1), and the demoscopy in this sense indicated that such beliefs are residual and have gradually decreased since 2010, from 8.5 points (Meira et al., 2011) to 3.5 points (Ideara, 2021). Relationships between internet searches for CC and media coverage of CC, the occurrence of extreme weather phenomena, and CC-related events were analyzed in this study to establish statistically significant differences among the searches using the four keywords analyzed. The results obtained indicate that the increase in news stories about CC in the media implies an increase in interest by the population in information on the internet about CC, a finding also found in previous studies of written press for Spain (FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes, 2015). However, it is striking, and to some extent worrisome, how this positive relationship is also established with the keyword â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ This is not an isolated fact; the confusion and interrelation between CC, the greenhouse effect, and the hole in the ozone layer are common in the existing scientific literature (Bozdogan, 2011). Thus, as stated by Meira (2007), this erroneous conceptualization has become part of the common culture, and the â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ is extensively used as a synonym for CC.\nUnlike the results obtained in previous studies (Lang, 2014; Lang and Ryder, 2016), the occurrence of extreme weather events did not increase the interest of the Spanish population in CC, at least not for three of the four keywords analyzed. This trend could indicate, therefore, that the Spanish population considers these phenomena as isolated events and not as consequences of CC or as having no influence on their interest or concern for this problem. This variation in searches on CC seems to coincide, precisely, with the data reported by studies on the perception of CC in Spain: in 2019, 66.5% of the Spanish population considered that CC was being given less importance than it should (Valdor et al., 2019), and in 2020, this percentage increased by 6.5 points (Ideara, 2021). However, this argument is controversial because this relationship has been observed with searches using the keyword â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ Therefore, we understand that the erroneous relationship between CC and the greenhouse effect continues to be perpetuated throughout society.\nThe occurrence of CC-related events, the last of the variables analyzed in this study, influenced the interest in CC among the Spanish population, especially during weeks in which these events recur. Previous research in this regard has yielded similar results: positive associations between interest in CC and student climate movements (Mavrodieva et al., 2019) or international climate meetings (Hartwell et al., 2020; FernÃ¡ndez-Reyes, 2015). Notably, this relationship is observed for the keywords â€œclimate change,â€ â€œglobal warmingâ€ and â€œclimate emergencyâ€ but not for â€œgreenhouse effect.â€ This finding may be due not only to the use of these words during these events, underscoring the importance and gravity of the problem, but also to the fact that the language and concepts used at such events invoke a greater degree of climate literacy.\nIn light of the results obtained in this study, it could be concluded that the interest of the Spanish population in CC has increased on the internet in recent years and that some of the variables that may influence this interest are media coverage of CC, CC-related events and the social pressure exerted by climate-related social movements. The interest of citizens in CC could indicate the degree of social concern for this problem and even serve as a factor of public pressure for effective solutions against CC. However, we cannot determine that greater interest in CC is necessarily related to support for the cause. In fact, peopleâ€™s support for the cause depends more on their values, ideologies, and political orientations than on other factors (Hornsey et al., 2016). Nevertheless, this does not obviate the need for the public to be properly informed about a problem such important as is CC.

Agents of change
This excerpt from my book includes several ideas for how you can help move us closer to a zero-carbon future.
When I talk to people about climate change, I almost always get asked the same question: What can I do to help? So, when I sat down to write my new book, I knew I wanted to include a chapter about what actions individuals can take to move us closer to a zero-carbon future.
It’s human nature to want to do something when you’re confronted with a problem—especially one as big as climate change. The good news is that there are things everyone can do. Although the most impactful steps we can take to avoid a climate disaster must happen at the governmental level, you have power to effect change as a citizen, a consumer, and an employee or employer.
Below is a book excerpt that covers the citizen and consumer categories. I hope it gives you some ideas for how you can help solve this urgent problem. (There will also be ways to partner with me through my work with Breakthrough Energy, my organization dedicated to putting the ideas in this book into action.)
Excerpt from How to Avoid a Climate Disaster
As a Citizen
When you ask yourself what you can do to limit climate change, it’s natural to think of things like driving an electric car or eating less meat. This sort of personal action is important for the signals it sends to the marketplace—see the next section for more on that point—but the bulk of our emissions comes from the larger systems in which we live our daily lives.
When somebody wants toast for breakfast, we need to make sure there’s a system in place that can deliver the bread, the toaster, and the electricity to run the toaster without adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. We aren’t going to solve the climate problem by telling people not to eat toast.
But putting this new energy system in place requires concerted political action. That’s why engaging in the political process is the most important single step that people from every walk of life can take to help avoid a climate disaster.
In my own meetings with politicians, I’ve found that it helps to remember that climate change isn’t the only thing on their plate. Government leaders are also thinking about education, jobs, health care, foreign policy, and more recently, COVID-19. And they should: All those things demand attention.
But policy makers can take on only so many problems at once. And they decide what to do, what to prioritize, based on what they’re hearing from their constituents.
In other words, elected officials will adopt specific plans for cli_mate change if their voters demand it. Thanks to activists around the world, we don’t need to generate demand: Millions of people are already calling for action. What we do need to do, though, is to translate these calls for action into pressure that encourages politi_cians to make the tough choices and trade-offs necessary to deliver on their promises to reduce emissions.
Whatever other resources you may have, you can always use your voice and your vote to effect change.
Make calls, write letters, attend town halls. What you can help your leaders understand is that it’s just as important for them to think about the long-term problem of climate change as it is for them to think about jobs or education or health care.
It may sound old-fashioned, but letters and phone calls to your elected officials can have a real impact. Senators and representatives get frequent reports on what their offices are hearing from constitu_ents. But don’t simply say, “Do something about climate change.” Know where they stand, ask them questions, and make clear that this is an issue that will help determine how you vote. Demand more funding for clean energy R&D, a clean energy standard, or a price on carbon, for example.
Look locally as well as nationally. A lot of the relevant decisions are made at the state and local levels by governors, mayors, state legislatures, and city councils—places where individual citizens can have an even bigger impact than at the federal level. In the United States, for example, electricity is primarily regulated by statewide public utility commissions, made up of either elected or appointed commissioners. Know who your representatives are and keep in touch with them.
Run for office. Running for the U.S. Congress is a tall order. But you don’t have to start there. You can run for state or local office, where you’ll probably have more impact anyway. We need all the policy smarts, courage, and creativity in public office that we can get.
As a Consumer
The market is ruled by supply and demand, and as a consumer you can have a huge impact on the demand side of the equation. If all of us make individual changes in what we buy and use, it can add up to a lot—as long as we focus on changes that are meaningful. For example, if you can afford to install a smart thermostat to reduce your energy consumption when you’re not at home, by all means do it. You’ll cut your utility bill and your greenhouse gas emissions.
But reducing your own carbon emissions isn’t the most powerful thing you can do. You can also send a signal to the market that people want zero-carbon alternatives and are willing to pay for them. When you pay more for an electric car, a heat pump, or a plant-based burger, you’re saying, “There’s a market for this stuff. We’ll buy it.” If enough people send the same signal, companies will respond—quite quickly, in my experience. They’ll put more money and time into making low-emissions products, which will drive down the prices of those products, which will help them get adopted in big numbers. It will make investors more confident about funding new companies that are making the breakthroughs that will help us get to zero.
Without that demand signal, the innovations that governments and businesses invest in will stay on the shelf. Or they won’t get developed in the first place, because there’s no economic incentive to make them.
Here are some specific steps you can take:
Sign up for a green pricing program with your electric utility. Some utility companies allow homes and businesses to pay extra for power from clean sources. In 13 states, utilities are required to offer this option. (You can see whether your state does by check_ing the Green Pricing Programs map at C2ES—the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.) Customers in these programs pay a premium on their electric bill to cover the extra cost of renewable energy, an average of one to two cents per kilowatt-hour, or $9 to $18 a month for the typical American home. When you participate in these pro_grams, you’re telling your utility company that you’re willing to pay more to address climate change. That’s an important market signal.
But what these programs don’t do is cancel out emissions or lead to meaningful increases in the amount of renewable power on the grid. Only government policies and increased investments can do that.
Reduce your home’s emissions. Depending on how much money and time you can spare, you can replace your incandescent lightbulbs with LEDs, install a smart thermostat, insulate your win_dows, buy efficient appliances, or replace your heating and cooling system with a heat pump (as long as you live in a climate where they can operate). If you rent your home, you can make the changes within your control—such as replacing lightbulbs—and encour_age your landlord to do the rest. If you’re building a new home or renovating an old one, you can opt for recycled steel and make the home more efficient by using structural insulated panels, insulating concrete forms, attic or roof radiant barriers, reflective insulation, and foundation insulation.
Buy an electric vehicle. EVs have come a long way in terms of cost and performance. Although they might not be right for everyone (they’re not great for lots of long-distance road trips, and charging at home isn’t convenient for everyone), they’re becoming more affordable for many consumers. This is one of the places where consumer behavior can have a huge impact: If people buy lots of them, companies will make lots of them.
Try a plant-based burger. I’ll admit that veggie burgers haven’t always tasted great, but the new generation of plant-based protein alternatives is better and closer to the taste and texture of meat than their predecessors. You can find them in many restaurants, grocery stores, and even fast-food joints. Buying these products sends a clear message that making them is a wise investment. In addition, eating a meat substitute (or simply not eating meat) just once or twice a week will cut down on the emissions you’re responsible for. The same goes for dairy products.
I have a higher-than-average carbon footprint, so I’m taking extra steps to do my part. In the book I briefly mention how I’m offsetting my own emissions. I spend about $5 million every year to offset my family’s carbon footprint. As of now, the standard calculation for carbon footprints is based on an estimate of $400 per ton of emissions. But since the way we calculate carbon footprints is still in its infancy, I take our family’s carbon footprint and double it to make sure we are fully covering our footprint and then some.
I also like to think of my investments in zero-carbon technologies as another kind of offset for my emissions. Investing in companies doesn’t make my carbon footprint smaller. But if I’ve picked any winners, they’ll be responsible for removing much more carbon than I am responsible for creating. I have given more than $1 billion toward innovations and ideas that I hope will help the world get to zero—including affordable and reliable clean energy, low-emissions cement, steel, meat, and more.
Although heavy emitters like me should use less energy, the world overall should be using more energy because that’s a key element to moving countries out of poverty and expanding our global economy. There is nothing wrong with using more energy as long as it’s carbon-free. The key to addressing climate change is to make clean energy just as cheap and reliable as what we get from fossil fuels.

So, when I sat down to write my new book, I knew I wanted to include a chapter about what actions individuals can take to move us closer to a zero-carbon future.\nIt’s human nature to want to do something when you’re confronted with a problem—especially one as big as climate change. The good news is that there are things everyone can do. Although the most impactful steps we can take to avoid a climate disaster must happen at the governmental level, you have power to effect change as a citizen, a consumer, and an employee or employer.\nBelow is a book excerpt that covers the citizen and consumer categories. I hope it gives you some ideas for how you can help solve this urgent problem. (There will also be ways to partner with me through my work with Breakthrough Energy, my organization dedicated to putting the ideas in this book into action.)\nExcerpt from How to Avoid a Climate Disaster\nAs a Citizen\nWhen you ask yourself what you can do to limit climate change, it’s natural to think of things like driving an electric car or eating less meat. This sort of personal action is important for the signals it sends to the marketplace—see the next section for more on that point—but the bulk of our emissions comes from the larger systems in which we live our daily lives.\nWhen somebody wants toast for breakfast, we need to make sure there’s a system in place that can deliver the bread, the toaster, and the electricity to run the toaster without adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. We aren’t going to solve the climate problem by telling people not to eat toast.\nBut putting this new energy system in place requires concerted political action. That’s why engaging in the political process is the most important single step that people from every walk of life can take to help avoid a climate disaster.\nIn my own meetings with politicians, I’ve found that it helps to remember that climate change isn’t the only thing on their plate. Government leaders are also thinking about education, jobs, health care, foreign policy, and more recently, COVID-19. And they should: All those things demand attention.\nBut policy makers can take on only so many problems at once. And they decide what to do, what to prioritize, based on what they’re hearing from their constituents.\nIn other words, elected officials will adopt specific plans for cli\xadmate change if their voters demand it. Thanks to activists around the world, we don’t need to generate demand: Millions of people are already calling for action. What we do need to do, though, is to translate these calls for action into pressure that encourages politi\xadcians to make the tough choices and trade-offs necessary to deliver on their promises to reduce emissions.\nWhatever other resources you may have, you can always use your voice and your vote to effect change.\nMake calls, write letters, attend town halls. What you can help your leaders understand is that it’s just as important for them to think about the long-term problem of climate change as it is for them to think about jobs or education or health care.\nIt may sound old-fashioned, but letters and phone calls to your elected officials can have a real impact. Senators and representatives get frequent reports on what their offices are hearing from constitu\xadents. But don’t simply say, “Do something about climate change.” Know where they stand, ask them questions, and make clear that this is an issue that will help determine how you vote. Demand more funding for clean energy R&D, a clean energy standard, or a price on carbon, for example.\nLook locally as well as nationally. A lot of the relevant decisions are made at the state and local levels by governors, mayors, state legislatures, and city councils—places where individual citizens can have an even bigger impact than at the federal level. In the United States, for example, electricity is primarily regulated by statewide public utility commissions, made up of either elected or appointed commissioners. Know who your representatives are and keep in touch with them.\nRun for office. Running for the U.S. Congress is a tall order. But you don’t have to start there. You can run for state or local office, where you’ll probably have more impact anyway. We need all the policy smarts, courage, and creativity in public office that we can get.\nAs a Consumer\nThe market is ruled by supply and demand, and as a consumer you can have a huge impact on the demand side of the equation. If all of us make individual changes in what we buy and use, it can add up to a lot—as long as we focus on changes that are meaningful. For example, if you can afford to install a smart thermostat to reduce your energy consumption when you’re not at home, by all means do it. You’ll cut your utility bill and your greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut reducing your own carbon emissions isn’t the most powerful thing you can do. You can also send a signal to the market that people want zero-carbon alternatives and are willing to pay for them. When you pay more for an electric car, a heat pump, or a plant-based burger, you’re saying, “There’s a market for this stuff. We’ll buy it.” If enough people send the same signal, companies will respond—quite quickly, in my experience. They’ll put more money and time into making low-emissions products, which will drive down the prices of those products, which will help them get adopted in big numbers. It will make investors more confident about funding new companies that are making the breakthroughs that will help us get to zero.\nWithout that demand signal, the innovations that governments and businesses invest in will stay on the shelf. Or they won’t get developed in the first place, because there’s no economic incentive to make them.\nHere are some specific steps you can take:\nSign up for a green pricing program with your electric utility. Some utility companies allow homes and businesses to pay extra for power from clean sources. In 13 states, utilities are required to offer this option. (You can see whether your state does by check\xading the Green Pricing Programs map at C2ES—the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.) Customers in these programs pay a premium on their electric bill to cover the extra cost of renewable energy, an average of one to two cents per kilowatt-hour, or $9 to $18 a month for the typical American home. When you participate in these pro\xadgrams, you’re telling your utility company that you’re willing to pay more to address climate change. That’s an important market signal.\nBut what these programs don’t do is cancel out emissions or lead to meaningful increases in the amount of renewable power on the grid. Only government policies and increased investments can do that.\nReduce your home’s emissions. Depending on how much money and time you can spare, you can replace your incandescent lightbulbs with LEDs, install a smart thermostat, insulate your win\xaddows, buy efficient appliances, or replace your heating and cooling system with a heat pump (as long as you live in a climate where they can operate). If you rent your home, you can make the changes within your control—such as replacing lightbulbs—and encour\xadage your landlord to do the rest. If you’re building a new home or renovating an old one, you can opt for recycled steel and make the home more efficient by using structural insulated panels, insulating concrete forms, attic or roof radiant barriers, reflective insulation, and foundation insulation.\nBuy an electric vehicle. EVs have come a long way in terms of cost and performance. Although they might not be right for everyone (they’re not great for lots of long-distance road trips, and charging at home isn’t convenient for everyone), they’re becoming more affordable for many consumers. This is one of the places where consumer behavior can have a huge impact: If people buy lots of them, companies will make lots of them.\nTry a plant-based burger. I’ll admit that veggie burgers haven’t always tasted great, but the new generation of plant-based protein alternatives is better and closer to the taste and texture of meat than their predecessors. You can find them in many restaurants, grocery stores, and even fast-food joints. Buying these products sends a clear message that making them is a wise investment. In addition, eating a meat substitute (or simply not eating meat) just once or twice a week will cut down on the emissions you’re responsible for.

We’re at a historic moment with the UNFCCC COP 21, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 21st Conference of the Parties, in Paris set to begin next month. With world leaders from 195 countries negotiating to reach a global agreement to reduce carbon emissions, expansive news and media coverage is guaranteed. What’s also guaranteed in this coverage is a host of scientific jargon and acronyms that can be overwhelming to follow, let alone understand.
So this week we’re breaking down climate science to its most basic key terms and phrases to help you better grasp what’s going on in the world with climate change, both at the UN climate talks and beyond.
We’ve got a lot of ground to cover, so let’s jump right in. Below is our list of the top terms you need to know to understand the basic science and political sphere of climate change.
The chemical compound carbon dioxide (also known by its shorthand CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas and driver of climate change. It’s an integral part of life cycles on earth, produced through animal respiration (including human respiration) and absorbed by plants to fuel their growth, to name just two ways. Human activities are drastically altering the carbon cycle in many ways. Two of the most impactful are: one, by burning fossil fuels and adding more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; and two, by affecting the ability of natural sinks (like forests) to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
A greenhouse gas is a chemical compound found in the Earth’s atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and other human-made gases. These gases allow much of the solar radiation to enter the atmosphere, where the energy strikes the Earth and warms the surface. Some of this energy is reflected back towards space as infrared radiation. A portion of this outgoing radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases, trapping the radiation in the atmosphere in the form of heat. The more greenhouse gas molecules there are in the atmosphere, the more heat is trapped, and the warmer it will become.
In the climate change space, emissions refer to greenhouse gases released into the air that are produced by numerous activities, including burning fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, and melting permafrost, to name a few. These gases cause heat to be trapped in the atmosphere, slowly increasing the Earth’s temperature over time.
It’s all about timing when it comes to differentiating weather and climate. Weather refers to atmospheric conditions in the short term, including changes in temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, brightness, wind, and visibility.
While the weather is always changing, especially over the short term, climate is the average of weather patterns over a longer period of time (usually 30 or more years). So the next time you hear someone question climate change by saying, “You know it’s freezing outside, right?”, you can gladly explain the difference between weather and climate.
Many people use these two terms interchangeably, but we think it’s important to acknowledge their differences. Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature from human-made greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth’s climate, or a region on Earth, and includes more than just the average surface temperature. For example, variations in the amount of snow,  sea levels, and sea ice can all be consequences of climate change.
Fossil fuels are sources of non-renewable energy, formed from the remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago. Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil to produce energy is where the majority of greenhouse gases originate. As the world has developed and demand for energy has grown, we’ve burned more fossil fuels, causing more greenhouse gases to be trapped in the atmosphere and air temperatures to rise.
Sea-level rise as it relates to climate change is caused by two major factors. First, more water is released into the ocean as glaciers and land ice melts. Second, the ocean expands as ocean temperatures increase. Both of these consequences of climate change are accelerating sea-level rise around the world, putting millions of people who live in coastal communities at risk.
Global average temperature is a long-term look at the Earth’s temperature, usually over the course of 30 years, on land and sea. Because weather patterns vary, causing temperatures to be higher or lower than average from time to time due to factors like ocean processes, cloud variability, volcanic activity, and other natural cycles, scientists take a longer-term view in order to consider all of the year-to-year changes.
RELATED: Ten Clear Indicators Our Climate Is Changing
Renewable energy is energy that comes from naturally replenished resources, such as sunlight, wind, waves, and geothermal heat. By the end of 2014, renewables were estimated to make up almost 28% of the world’s power generating capacity, enough to supply almost 23% of global electricity. Because renewables don’t produce the greenhouse gases driving climate change, shifting away from fossil fuels to renewables to power our lives will put us on the path to a safe, sustainable planet for future generations.
These two abbreviations are best described together as they work hand-in-hand. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an environmental treaty that nations joined in 1992, with the goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.
Meanwhile, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC is a yearly international climate conference where nations assess progress and determine next steps for action through the UNFCCC treaty. This year marks the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21), which will be held in Paris beginning November 30. Here, a historic global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is on the table and, if passed, will mark a landmark achievement in the fight against climate change.
INDC stands for “Intended Nationally Determined Contribution.” In preparation for the UN climate talks later this year, countries have outlined what actions they intend to take beginning in 2020 under a proposed global climate agreement. These plans are known as INDCs, which will play a big part in moving us forward on the path toward a low-carbon, clean energy future.
IPCC is the acronym for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. First set up in 1988 under two UN organizations, the IPCC surveys the research on climate change happening all around the world and reports to the public about the current state of our scientific knowledge.
PPM stands for “parts per million,” which is a way of expressing the concentration of one component in the larger sample. Climate scientists and activists use the term to describe the concentration of pollutants, like carbon dioxide or methane, in the atmosphere. Many scientists agree that carbon dioxide levels should be at 350 PPM to be considered safe; we’re at about 400 PPM right now and this number is growing by approximately 2 PPM each year.
Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide refers to carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution. Scientists estimate these pre-industrial levels were about 280 PPM, well below where we are today.
Methane is a chemical compound that’s the main component of natural gas, a common fossil fuel source. Just like carbon dioxide, methane is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. Methane accounts for about 10 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions (using 2013 figures), second only to carbon dioxide.
Many people don’t understand the negative effects of methane as an alternative to other fossil fuels. While methane doesn’t stay in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, it absorbs 84 times more heat, making it very harmful to the climate.
Mitigation refers to an action that will reduce or prevent greenhouse gas emissions, such as planting trees in order to absorb more CO2. It can also include developing and deploying new technologies, using renewable energies like wind and solar, or making older equipment more energy efficient.

Weather refers to atmospheric conditions in the short term, including changes in temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, brightness, wind, and visibility.\nWhile the weather is always changing, especially over the short term, climate is the average of weather patterns over a longer period of time (usually 30 or more years). So the next time you hear someone question climate change by saying, “You know it’s freezing outside, right?”, you can gladly explain the difference between weather and climate.\nMany people use these two terms interchangeably, but we think it’s important to acknowledge their differences. Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature from human-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nOn the other hand, climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth’s climate, or a region on Earth, and includes more than just the average surface temperature. For example, variations in the amount of snow,\xa0 sea levels, and sea ice can all be consequences of climate change.\nFossil fuels are sources of non-renewable energy, formed from the remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago.\xa0Burning fossil fuels\xa0like coal and oil to produce energy\xa0is where the majority of greenhouse gases originate. As the world has developed and demand for energy has grown, we’ve burned more fossil fuels, causing more greenhouse gases to be trapped in the atmosphere and air temperatures to rise.\nSea-level rise as it relates to climate change is caused by two major factors. First, more water is released into the ocean as glaciers and land ice melts. Second, the ocean expands as ocean temperatures increase. Both of these consequences of climate change are accelerating sea-level rise around the world, putting millions of people who live in coastal communities at risk.\nGlobal average temperature is a long-term look at the Earth’s temperature, usually over the course of 30 years, on land and sea. Because weather patterns vary, causing temperatures to be higher or lower than average from time to time due to factors like ocean processes, cloud variability, volcanic activity, and other natural cycles, scientists take a longer-term view in order to consider all of the year-to-year changes.\nRELATED: Ten Clear Indicators Our Climate Is Changing\nRenewable energy is energy that comes from naturally replenished resources, such as sunlight, wind, waves, and geothermal heat. By the end of 2014, renewables were estimated to make up almost 28% of the world’s power generating capacity, enough to supply almost 23% of global electricity. Because renewables don’t produce the greenhouse gases driving climate change, shifting away from fossil fuels to renewables to power our lives will put us on the path to a safe, sustainable planet for future generations.\nThese two abbreviations are best described together as they work hand-in-hand. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an environmental treaty that nations\xa0joined in 1992, with the goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.\nMeanwhile, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC is a yearly international climate conference where nations assess progress and determine next steps for action through the UNFCCC treaty. This year marks the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21), which will be held in Paris beginning November 30. Here, a historic global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is on the table and, if passed, will mark a landmark achievement in the fight against climate change.\nINDC stands for “Intended Nationally Determined Contribution.” In preparation for the UN climate talks later this year, countries have outlined what actions they intend to take beginning in 2020 under a proposed global climate agreement. These plans are known as INDCs, which will play a big part in moving us forward on the path toward a low-carbon, clean energy future.\nIPCC is the acronym for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. First set up in 1988 under two UN organizations, the IPCC surveys the research on climate change happening all around the world and reports to the public about the current state of our scientific knowledge.\nPPM stands for “parts per million,” which is a way of expressing the concentration of one component in the larger sample. Climate scientists and activists use the term to describe the concentration of pollutants, like carbon dioxide or methane, in the atmosphere. Many scientists agree that carbon dioxide levels should be at 350 PPM to be considered safe; we’re at about 400 PPM right now and this number is growing by approximately 2 PPM each year.\nPre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide refers to carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution. Scientists estimate these pre-industrial levels were about 280 PPM, well below where we are today.\nMethane is a chemical compound that’s the main component of natural gas, a common fossil fuel source. Just like carbon dioxide, methane is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. Methane accounts for about 10 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions (using 2013 figures), second only to carbon dioxide.\nMany people don’t understand the negative effects of methane as an alternative to other fossil fuels. While methane doesn’t stay in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, it absorbs 84 times more heat, making it very harmful to the climate.\nMitigation refers to an action that will reduce or prevent greenhouse gas emissions, such as planting trees in order to absorb more CO2. It can also include developing and deploying new technologies, using renewable energies like wind and solar, or making older equipment more energy efficient.\nStay tuned for more climate science coming up in future blog posts. \xa0In the meantime, sign up for our email activist list and we’ll keep you up to date on what’s happening and how you can get involved in the movement for climate solutions.\nSo, are you ready to make a difference for the future of our planet?\nAcross the country and around the world, everyday activists supporting sustainable solutions in their communities are making the difference in the fight against the climate crisis.

Revised on
May 31, 2023.
It’s important to know how to find relevant sources when writing a research paper, literature review, or systematic review.
The types of sources you need will depend on the stage you are at in the research process, but all sources that you use should be credible, up to date, and relevant to your research topic.
There are three main places to look for sources to use in your research:
Table of contents
Research databases
You can search for scholarly sources online using databases and search engines like Google Scholar. These provide a range of search functions that can help you to find the most relevant sources.
If you are searching for a specific article or book, include the title or the author’s name. Alternatively, if you’re just looking for sources related to your research problem, you can search using keywords. In this case, it’s important to have a clear understanding of the scope of your project and of the most relevant keywords.
Databases can be general (interdisciplinary) or subject-specific.
Example: JSTOR discipline search filter
Check the table below to find a database that’s relevant to your research.
Google Scholar
To get started, you might also try Google Scholar, an academic search engine that can help you find relevant books and articles. Its “Cited by” function lets you see the number of times a source has been cited. This can tell you something about a source’s credibility and importance to the field.
Example: Google Scholar “Cited by” function
Boolean operators
Boolean operators can also help to narrow or expand your search.
Boolean operators are words and symbols like AND, OR, and NOT that you can use to include or exclude keywords to refine your results. For example, a search for “Nietzsche NOT nihilism” will provide results that include the word “Nietzsche” but exclude results that contain the word “nihilism.”
Many databases and search engines have an advanced search function that allows you to refine results in a similar way without typing the Boolean operators manually.
Example: Project Muse advanced search

Frequently asked questions about finding sources
You can find sources online using databases and search engines like Google Scholar. Use Boolean operators or advanced search functions to narrow or expand your search.
For print sources, you can use your institution’s library database. This will allow you to explore the library’s catalog and to search relevant keywords.
It is important to find credible sources and use those that you can be sure are sufficiently scholarly.
When searching for sources in databases, think of specific keywords that are relevant to your topic, and consider variations on them or synonyms that might be relevant.
Once you have a clear idea of your research parameters and key terms, choose a database that is relevant to your research (e.g., Medline, JSTOR, Project MUSE).
Find out if the database has a “subject search” option. This can help to refine your search. Use Boolean operators to combine your keywords, exclude specific search terms, and search exact phrases to find the most relevant sources.
There are many types of sources commonly used in research. These include:
You’ll likely use a variety of these sources throughout the research process, and the kinds of sources you use will depend on your research topic and goals.
Scholarly sources are written by experts in their field and are typically subjected to peer review. They are intended for a scholarly audience, include a full bibliography, and use scholarly or technical language. For these reasons, they are typically considered credible sources.
Popular sources like magazines and news articles are typically written by journalists. These types of sources usually don’t include a bibliography and are written for a popular, rather than academic, audience. They are not always reliable and may be written from a biased or uninformed perspective, but they can still be cited in some contexts.

2025 Or Bust: Patagonia’s Carbon Neutrality Goal
Patagonia set a goal to become carbon neutral by 2025. To get us there, we’re trying out a lot of different things, including growing food and fiber the way nature intended. Regenerative organic cotton fields in India. Photo: Hashim Badani
In Japan, it is possible to simultaneously stand both in a cultivated field and under a solar array. A group of engineers and entrepreneurs developed a model whereby solar panels can be installed on top of existing farmland and still allow the required amount of sunlight to reach the crops below. These collaborations between businesses and farmers, known as solar sharing, or agrivoltaics, are beginning to spread around the country. After visiting one of the first operating solar-sharing arrays, Patagonia Japan sponsored a 50-kilowatt project in the Chiba Prefecture, about an hour away from our surf shop in Ichinomiya. This successful pilot program inspired Patagonia Japan to expand its investments in solar sharing, just approving two more projects totaling over 600 kilowatts.
“Japan is a small country where there are not many flat landscapes or space overall, really,” says Junichi Sato, environmental and social initiatives director for Patagonia Japan. “We have been campaigning to increase the capacity of renewables, but solar energy developers and investors have been installing them on top of mountains by clear-cutting forests.” Through solar sharing, Patagonia Japan has been able to offset a large portion of the emissions produced in their retail stores, reduce the amount of land lost to large-scale developments and provide farmers with supplemental income from selling the renewable energy produced on their land.
This effort to source renewable energy for a small number of retail stores is part of a much larger effort by Patagonia to address a glaring problem: The clothing industry is responsible for a whopping 10 percent of global carbon emissions_more than the combined emissions of international flights and maritime shipping. Every part of the clothing industry contributes to the climate crisis in some way. Most clothes are made in factories that rely heavily on energy from coal and gas. Synthetic materials, such as polyester, are especially carbon intensive, but even clothes made from natural fabrics, like hemp or cotton, strip soil of nutrients and release carbon trapped in the ground into the atmosphere, further warming our planet. If business continues as usual, the clothing industry is expected to need three times as many resources to keep up with consumer demand by 2050. If we’re to keep Earth livable in the future, the clothing industry must change.
To get to net zero, we have to use offsets, like sponsoring this project in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Solar sharing allows farmers to simultaneously grow crops and harness energy from the sun. Photo: Patagonia Japan
At Patagonia, approximately 95 percent of our carbon emissions come from our supply chain_the term that textile manufacturers use to describe everything from the crops grown to make yarn, to shipping finished clothes to warehouses, stores and our customers’ front steps. To reduce Patagonia’s impact on people and the planet, we are working toward becoming carbon neutral across our entire business, including our supply chain, by 2025.
Switching to Renewable Energy
As an intermediate step, we are planning for 100 percent of the electricity we use in our global owned and operated locations to come from renewable energy by the end of 2020. The Patagonia headquarters in Ventura and our distribution center in Reno already feature on-site solar arrays, and we are now installing four more arrays between the two campuses_the largest being a 1-megawatt array at our distribution center, which will cover roughly 80 percent of our electricity use in this location. To address the balance of our domestic use, Tin Shed Ventures®, our in-house venture capital arm, invested in more than 1,500 residential solar projects across the United States, which yield Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) that Patagonia uses to offset its US-based electricity consumption.
“As we look at carbon neutrality, I think investing is going to be a key part in getting us there,” says Phil Graves, Patagonia’s director of corporate development. “We are trying to find projects that would not happen if we didn’t put up the investment capital. If we are able to identify and invest in these projects, we can put additional solar power on the grid.”

At our regional office in Amsterdam, we worked with the other tenants in the building to convince the landlord to source 100 percent wind power for the building and are looking at investing in solar projects on farms in the nearby countryside. In Australia, we installed solar panels at our office and one of our retail stores, making up 25 percent of Patagonia Australia’s energy needs. To cover the rest of our electricity footprint there, we are looking at installing solar panels in a community north of Melbourne that lacks access to stable electricity And there are the solar-sharing efforts being undertaken by Patagonia Japan.
“We’re trying to use a similar model in each of the countries where we have an owned and operated footprint,” says Paul Hendricks, Patagonia’s senior manager of environmental responsibility. Where we can’t switch to renewable sources yet, we can balance our electricity footprint by investing in offsite renewable energy projects, particularly those that bring additional benefits to local communities.
Addressing Our Supply Chain
Switching our stores and offices to renewable energy is the easy part. To truly limit our emissions, we have to mitigate the overwhelming impact of our supply chain. Nearly 86 percent of Patagonia’s total carbon emissions come from the creation of the materials used in our products. To become carbon-neutral by 2025, we need to reduce and eliminate these emissions, and getting there requires multiple strategies.
Switching to recycled and renewable inputs is a big part of the solution, as is the development of low-emission dyeing techniques and biobased and biodegradable materials. To date, we’ve made significant progress on recycling the high-quality polyester and nylon we use in many of our best products. In 1993, Patagonia was the first outdoor clothing manufacturer to transform trash into fleece, and this fall, 69 percent of all materials used in Patagonia products will be recycled. By using recycled materials in this one season alone, we are reducing our carbon footprint by 20,000 tons of CO2e_that’s like taking 4,200 cars off the road for one year.

But material changes will never bring us to net-zero emissions. So Patagonia’s environmental responsibility team is working on the long-term goal of converting our suppliers, the businesses we work with across our supply chain, to reduce the amount of energy used in their operations. Strategies to do so are broad in scope, from installing more energy efficient machinery to using renewable energy in their operations. These tactics will ensure that any product that comes out of one of these factories has a lower carbon footprint.This is a behemoth task, given our number of suppliers and the way renewable energy policies differ from country to country_nonetheless, it is one that we are committed to seeing through by partnering closely with our suppliers and imagining innovative ways to fund these changes
Beyond these efforts, Patagonia is investing in carbon sequestration projects that we believe could eventually help reverse the climate crisis. Through regenerative organic agriculture and reforestation in particular, Patagonia is looking to expand efforts that capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it deep in the soil, where it can no longer wreak havoc.
But balancing our absolute carbon emissions with external investments and carbon sequestration initiatives is not our ultimate goal. “I see Patagonia’s carbon-neutral by 2025 goal more as the starting point in our carbon-neutrality journey,” says Hendricks. “Ultimately, we want to rely less and less on offset mechanisms and see our gross emissions plummet toward zero.”
Our goal to get to net zero is just the first step and we eventually want to be in a place where we rely less on offsets and see our emissions drop towards zero. To do this, we need business and customers to join the movement. A worker pushes packages in New York. Photo: Christopher Lee/Getty Images
We Can’t Do It Alone
To really make a difference, though, we need customers and other businesses to join in this movement. When compared to Nike’s whopping $36-billion business, Patagonia is still a relatively small company. We need more brands_especially the big ones_to look for ways to lessen their impact on people and the planet. And we need their customers to ask them to step up.
“The climate crisis is staring at us in the face and we’ve got to do something about it,” says Hendricks. “For so long, businesses have taken incremental steps toward sustainability. We have 11 years to turn this ship around. At Patagonia, we decided we need to go all in. We can’t just set small goals, we have to go for it.”

To get us there, we’re trying out a lot of different things, including growing food and fiber the way nature intended. Regenerative organic cotton fields in India. Photo: Hashim Badani\nIn Japan, it is possible to simultaneously stand both in a cultivated field and under a solar array. A group of engineers and entrepreneurs developed a model whereby solar panels can be installed on top of existing farmland and still allow the required amount of sunlight to reach the crops below. These collaborations between businesses and farmers, known as solar sharing, or agrivoltaics, are beginning to spread around the country. After visiting one of the first operating solar-sharing arrays, Patagonia Japan sponsored a 50-kilowatt project in the Chiba Prefecture, about an hour away from our surf shop in Ichinomiya. This successful pilot program inspired Patagonia Japan to expand its investments in solar sharing, just approving two more projects totaling over 600 kilowatts.\n“Japan is a small country where there are not many flat landscapes or space overall, really,” says Junichi Sato, environmental and social initiatives director for Patagonia Japan. “We have been campaigning to increase the capacity of renewables, but solar energy developers and investors have been installing them on top of mountains by clear-cutting forests.” Through solar sharing, Patagonia Japan has been able to offset a large portion of the emissions produced in their retail stores, reduce the amount of land lost to large-scale developments and provide farmers with supplemental income from selling the renewable energy produced on their land.\nThis effort to source renewable energy for a small number of retail stores is part of a much larger effort by Patagonia to address a glaring problem: The clothing industry is responsible for a whopping 10 percent of global carbon emissions_more than the combined emissions of international flights and maritime shipping. Every part of the clothing industry contributes to the climate crisis in some way. Most clothes are made in factories that rely heavily on energy from coal and gas. Synthetic materials, such as polyester, are especially carbon intensive, but even clothes made from natural fabrics, like hemp or cotton, strip soil of nutrients and release carbon trapped in the ground into the atmosphere, further warming our planet. If business continues as usual, the clothing industry is expected to need three times as many resources to keep up with consumer demand by 2050. If we’re to keep Earth livable in the future, the clothing industry must change.\nTo get to net zero, we have to use offsets, like sponsoring this project in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Solar sharing allows farmers to simultaneously grow crops and harness energy from the sun. Photo: Patagonia Japan\nAt Patagonia, approximately 95 percent of our carbon emissions come from our supply chain_the term that textile manufacturers use to describe everything from the crops grown to make yarn, to shipping finished clothes to warehouses, stores and our customers’ front steps. To reduce Patagonia’s impact on people and the planet, we are working toward becoming carbon neutral across our entire business, including our supply chain, by 2025.\nSwitching to Renewable Energy\nAs an intermediate step, we are planning for 100 percent of the electricity we use in our global owned and operated locations to come from renewable energy by the end of 2020. The Patagonia headquarters in Ventura and our distribution center in Reno already feature on-site solar arrays, and we are now installing four more arrays between the two campuses_the largest being a 1-megawatt array at our distribution center, which will cover roughly 80 percent of our electricity use in this location. To address the balance of our domestic use, Tin Shed Ventures®, our in-house venture capital arm, invested in more than 1,500 residential solar projects across the United States, which yield Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) that Patagonia uses to offset its US-based electricity consumption.\n“As we look at carbon neutrality, I think investing is going to be a key part in getting us there,” says Phil Graves, Patagonia’s director of corporate development. “We are trying to find projects that would not happen if we didn’t put up the investment capital. If we are able to identify and invest in these projects, we can put additional solar power on the grid.”\nSolar arrays being installed on the roof of our distribution center in Reno. These panels will soon generate 80 percent of our energy needs at this location. Photo: Ryan Inskip\nAt our regional office in Amsterdam, we worked with the other tenants in the building to convince the landlord to source 100 percent wind power for the building and are looking at investing in solar projects on farms in the nearby countryside. In Australia, we installed solar panels at our office and one of our retail stores, making up 25 percent of Patagonia Australia’s energy needs. To cover the rest of our electricity footprint there, we are looking at installing solar panels in a community north of Melbourne that lacks access to stable electricity And there are the solar-sharing efforts being undertaken by Patagonia Japan.\n“We’re trying to use a similar model in each of the countries where we have an owned and operated footprint,” says Paul Hendricks, Patagonia’s senior manager of environmental responsibility. Where we can’t switch to renewable sources yet, we can balance our electricity footprint by investing in offsite renewable energy projects, particularly those that bring additional benefits to local communities.\nAddressing Our Supply Chain\nSwitching our stores and offices to renewable energy is the easy part. To truly limit our emissions, we have to mitigate the overwhelming impact of our supply chain. Nearly 86 percent of Patagonia’s total carbon emissions come from the creation of the materials used in our products. To become carbon-neutral by 2025, we need to reduce and eliminate these emissions, and getting there requires multiple strategies.\nSwitching to recycled and renewable inputs is a big part of the solution, as is the development of low-emission dyeing techniques and biobased and biodegradable materials. To date, we’ve made significant progress on recycling the high-quality polyester and nylon we use in many of our best products. In 1993, Patagonia was the first outdoor clothing manufacturer to transform trash into fleece, and this fall, 69 percent of all materials used in Patagonia products will be recycled. By using recycled materials in this one season alone, we are reducing our carbon footprint by 20,000 tons of CO2e_that’s like taking 4,200 cars off the road for one year.\nThe clothing industry generates up to 10% of global emissions every year, contributing to the climate crisis.

Abstract
Heatwaves have increased in intensity, frequency and duration, with these trends projected to worsen under enhanced global warming. Understanding regional heatwave trends has critical implications for the biophysical and human systems they impact. Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered byÂ the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.

Introduction
Defined as prolonged periods of excessive heat1, heatwaves are a specific type of extreme temperature event. There are many adverse impacts of heatwaves, including on human health2, agriculture3,4, workplace productivity5, wildfire frequency and intensity6, and public infrastructure7,8. The inequality of heatwave impacts has been assessed5,9, adversely affecting developing nations due to a lack of adaptive capacity, as well as varying cultural constraints. These impacts will increase under enhanced global warming, where more rapid heatwave trends will likely produce more severe and possibly irreversible impacts in some sectors9,10,11,12.
There are multiple characteristics to heatwaves, including their intensity, frequency, duration, timing and spatial extent. Additionally, there are numerous ways to define each characteristic, a likely consequence of their expansive impacts as well as potential limitations of the datasets from which they are assessed. There is a general consensus that the intensity, frequency and duration of heatwaves have increased in the observational record, both regionally and globally1,13,14,15,16,17. However, all relevant studies have employed diverse metrics, analysed a subset of heatwave characteristics over selected regions, and/or used different extreme thresholds over varying time periods. This undermines a comprehensive understanding of how heatwaves have changed at regional and global scales. An all-inclusive and consistent assessment is imperative for establishing confidence in the general consensus suggested by previous disparate studies, as well as being an integral component in accurately assessing the occurrence of and changes in heatwave impacts.
This study provides such an assessment. While data availability limits our analysis to begin in 1950, we find that trends in the spatially consistent Berkeley Earth18 observational dataset match well with common regions between the previously used quasi-global HadGHCND19 dataset and Berkeley Earth is thus useful in furthering our understanding of global and regional changes in heatwaves. Heatwave frequency demonstrates the most significant increase across almost all regions, with nowhere experiencing a significant decrease. While average heatwave intensity displays little change, cumulative heatwave intensity increases at a similar rate to heatwave frequency. Moreover, the most intense heatwave seasons as defined by cumulative intensity generally occur post 2000. By assessing regional trends that commence from all years between 1950 and 2000, we find that the increasing trends of historical heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative intensity have accelerated over many regions. However, climate variability can be a large influence on heatwave trends over timescales of multiple decades, even in recent decades, which are more heavily influenced by enhanced anthropogenic climate change.
Results
Global trends in heatwave characteristics
A previous attempt to address global observed heatwave changes13 employed the HadGHCND19 dataset and computed trends for 1950âˆ’2011. Although a plethora of metrics exist, we define heatwaves using a consistent methodological framework1. This is when at least 3 consecutive days are above a percentile-based extreme threshold over a 5-month warm season (see â€œMethodsâ€). We assess changes in heatwave frequency, duration and intensity, and also trends in seasonal cumulative heat, briefly expressed as the sum of the temperature anomaly relative to the respective heatwave threshold, across all heatwave days within the season (see â€œMethodsâ€ for more detailed explanations of heatwave characteristics). The cumulative heat metric provides additional and relevant information for impacts12 that is presented here at global and regional scales, alongside the more traditional heatwave metrics used in climate-based studies.
We primarily focus on the Berkeley Earth observational dataset18 (see â€œMethodsâ€) and analyse trends both globally and over the Special Report on Extremes (SREX) regions11 (see Supplementary TableÂ 1). To explore the validity of Berkeley Earth in measuring heatwave trends, we compare the two datasets (Fig.Â 1) for heatwave frequency (Fig. 1a, b), duration (Fig. 1c, d), intensity (Fig. 1e, f) and cumulative heat (Fig. 1g, h; see â€œMethodsâ€) where trends span 1950âˆ’2014. Note that HadGHCND can only produce a quasi-global assessment of heatwave changes, due to large amounts of missing data over Central and South America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, northern Canada and Greenland, inhibiting a true assessment of observed heatwave changes. In addition, the coarse resolution of 3.75Â° longitude by 2.5Â° latitude grid hampers an assessment of heatwave changes at the scales useful for understanding impacts. On the other hand, over the same time period Berkeley Earth provides much greater spatial coverage at a finer resolution (1Â° longitude by 1Â° latitude). Although the methods for constructing Berkeley Earth differ from HadGHCND, there is high agreement of the magnitude and significance of heatwave trends for common regions (Fig.Â 1). Agreement also occurs for trends commencing in subsequent decades (see Supplementary Figs.Â 1âˆ’4). Despite which year heatwave trends commence, the level of agreement between the datasets remains high. Moreover, while trend magnitudes generally increase through time the significance decreases, due to the increasing influence of climate variability on heatwaves over shorter timescales20,21, which is reflected by both datasets.
Trends in seasonal heatwave days (a, b); length of longest heatwave (c, d); average heatwave intensity (e, f); and cumulative heat (g, h) for quasi-global observational dataset HadGHCND (a, c, e, g) and global observational dataset Berkeley Earth (b, d, f, h) over the period 1950âˆ’2014. Trends are expressed as days decadeâˆ’1 for (aâˆ’d), and Â°C decadeâˆ’1 for (eâˆ’h).
According to Berkeley Earth, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most widespread and significant increase of the characteristics analysed (Fig.Â 1b). Heatwave duration (Fig.Â 1d), although increasing, has significant trends restricted to South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia. Significant heatwave intensity trends (Fig.Â 1f) are non-existent for most of the globe, the exception being southern Australia and small areas of Africa and South America. On the other hand, significant cumulative heat trends (Fig.Â 1h) are comparable in space to heatwave frequency (Fig.Â 1b), with mainly positive magnitudes. The largest trends are seen over the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, where the extra heat produced by heatwaves is increasing by 10â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1. For most other areas with significant trends, cumulative heat increases by 2âˆ’6â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1.
Regional trends in heatwave characteristics
Our employment of Berkeley Earth allows for the first comprehensive assessment of regional changes in observed heatwaves (TableÂ 1, Supplementary TableÂ 2), where adequate data exist for almost all of the 26 SREX regions (see â€œMethodsâ€, exception is Canada, Greenland, Iceland; CGI). During 1950âˆ’2017 (TableÂ 1), the largest trends were mainly over low-latitude regions. At least one extra heatwave day has occurred each decade over the majority of regions between 1950 and 2017 (though this can be as high as 3âˆ’5 days decadeâˆ’1 over low-latitude areas), and heatwaves have increased in length by between 0.2 to over 1 day decadeâˆ’1. In general, regional trends beginning in a later decade can be larger in magnitude (Supplementary TableÂ 2), which is at least in part due to greater overall warming of the global climate in later decades22. However later regional trends also bare less significance (Supplementary TableÂ 2, Figs.Â 3c, d, 4d), due to the influence of internal climate variability at shorter timescales20,23. Only one region (Central North America; CNA) shows no significant change for all heatwave characteristics. These trends are in line with other reported temperature changes over this region24,25.
While regional trends in heatwave frequency, maximum duration, and cumulative heat are mostly significantly increasing (exception is CNA, see above), trends in average intensity are only significant for regions Amazon (AMZ), Mediterranean (MED), North East Brazil (NEB), Southeast South America (SSA) and West Asia (WAS). Nine regions, as well as the global average, have slightly decreasing (though non-significant) trends in average intensity. Therefore, it is unlikely that the regional changes in average intensity are responsible for larger, more significant increases in cumulative heat.
Although mostly insignificant, trends in average intensity are smaller (or as mentioned above, even decreased) for most regions than global warming over the same time period (0.1â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1 since 1950)26. By itself, this result is not entirely surprising since the heatwave definition used here is based on a fixed threshold (see â€œMethodsâ€); thus, average intensity is inversely proportional to the number of heatwave days. Therefore, as the number of heatwave days increase (Fig.Â 1b, TableÂ 1), little or no change in average intensity can be expected. However, measuring heatwave intensity in this manner does not address the fact that more heatwaves mean more overall exposure to extreme temperatures. Indeed, other well-used measures of heatwave intensity such as the hottest heatwave day1,13,27â€”which generally have more significant trends than average intensityâ€”also do not account for this. Our assessment of cumulative heat fills this gap. Consistent with global changes (Fig.Â 1h), regional changes in cumulative heat have increased since 1950. Trends range from ~1â€‰Â°C to 4.5â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1 and are significant for all but one region (CNA, discussed above). This demonstrates that the integration of anomalies over heatwave days (see â€œMethodsâ€) has resulted in a substantial increase in the overall extreme heat experienced during heatwaves across almost every region. This is a concern in regard to the many adverse heatwave impacts, where greater overall exposure bears more influence than changes in the intensity of a specific heatwave day, or the overall average2,5,7,8,9,19,28,29.
Cumulative heat analysis
The highest amount of cumulative heat across all heatwaves for a given season varies regionally (Fig.Â 2a). For example, around an extra 80â€‰Â°C of heat was experienced during the worst heatwave season over Australia, whereas over 240â€‰Â°C of extra heat was felt during western Russiaâ€™s worst season (Fig.Â 2a). The Mediterranean and Siberia have both experienced seasons where heatwaves contributed an extra 200â€‰Â°C, and Alaska experienced its worst season where 150â€‰Â°C extra heat was contributed (Fig.Â 2a). Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the worldâ€™s worst heatwave seasons as measured by cumulative heat have occurred since 2000, with the vast majority occurring since the 1980s (Fig.Â 2b).
The highest seasonal cumulative heat (sum of anomalies relative to the calendar-day 90th percentile) (a); the year in which this value occurs (b); decadal trends in the percentage change of cumulative heat (c) and heatwave days (d); the average anomaly of a heatwave day (e) and the respective decadal trend (f). All values are calculated for the global observational dataset Berkeley Earth, for 1950âˆ’2017.
Cumulative heat is the product of all seasonal heatwave days (i.e. heatwave frequency) and average heatwave intensity (see â€œMethodsâ€). Thus, it is worth noting that the pattern and magnitude of trends in cumulative heat (Fig.Â 2c) looks very similar to that of heatwave frequency (Fig.Â 2d), when both characteristics are presented as percentage change (see â€œMethodsâ€). Significant trends are biggest over northern South America, the Middle East, the Maritime Continent and much of Africa, at 50% decadeâˆ’1. However, significant trends between 10 and 30% decadeâˆ’1 exist over most other regions.
The average anomaly a given heatwave day contributes to cumulative heat shows a noteworthy latitudinal gradient (Fig.Â 2e). Heatwave days in high latitudes contribute, on average, 2âˆ’3â€‰Â°C of extra heat dayâˆ’1 during a heatwave. In the Tropics, each heatwave day contributes between 0.5 and 1â€‰Â°C. Moreover, during 1950âˆ’2017, trends in this value are quite small with patchy significance (Fig.Â 2f). However, regions that display the largest trends in cumulative heat (Figs.Â 1h and 2c) also have a significant trend in the average contribution of a heatwave day towards cumulative heat.
How trends themselves are changing
The heatwave trends discussed thus far are long-term changes over a period with substantial inter-regional and interannual variability, and intensifying global warming (Figs.Â 3a, b, 4a, b); so constant trends should not be assumed. Moreover, the combination of intensifying anthropogenic influence on the global climate, and the measurable influence of internal variability on heatwaves20,23, strongly suggests that the trends themselves are not stable. However, previous assessments on the influence of internal variability on heatwaves has been limited to physical climate models20,23. For selected regions (see Supplementary TableÂ 1), we present trends in each heatwave metric commencing in the years 1950âˆ’2000 inclusive and truncating in 2017 (Figs.Â 3c, d, 4c, d).
Selected timeseries of heatwave days (a); and length of longest heatwave (b). Decadal trends in heatwave days (c); and length of longest heatwave (d) commencing yearly between 1950 and 2000 and truncating in 2017. All values are calculated for the global observational dataset Berkeley Earth (see â€œMethodsâ€). Closed circles in (c) and (d) indicate when trends commencing in that year are NOT statistically significant at the 5% level (see â€œMethodsâ€). Regions displayed are Central North America (CNA), East Asia (EAS), Mediterranean (MED), North Asia (NAS), North Australia (NAU), North Europe (NEU), West North America (WNA), and the global average (Wor).

Decadal trends in average heatwave intensity (c); and cumulative heat (d) commencing yearly between 1950 and 2000 and truncating in 2017. All values are calculated for the global observational dataset Berkeley Earth (see â€œMethodsâ€).

Regions displayed are Central North America (CNA), East Asia (EAS), Mediterranean (MED), North Asia (NAS), North Australia (NAU), North Europe (NEU), West North America (WNA), and the global average (Wor).
Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat (Figs.Â 3c, d, 4d) continue to increase in magnitude and remain significant when commencing in 1950 until at least 1970s. The exception is again CNA, where trends commencing in the early 1950s are not significant yet gain significance when commencing between the mid 1950sâˆ’1970s. This means that not only has the overall number of heatwave days, the length of the longest event and the extra heat experienced during heatwaves increased, but the speed at which these changes have occurred has accelerated during this timeframe. Note that for regions MED, WNA, East Asia (EAS), North Asia (NAS), and Northern Europe (NEU), as well as the global average, frequency and duration trends continue to accelerate up to trends commencing in the 1990s (Figs.Â 3c, d, 4d). Over MED, for example, heatwave frequency increases by over 2 days decadeâˆ’1 for trends commencing in 1950, accelerating to 6.4 days decadeâˆ’1 for trends commencing in the early 1980s (Fig.Â 3c). Acceleration of observed heatwave trends is not all that surprising given increasing global warming, and assessments of heatwave trends and individual events from climate models27,30,31.
By the 1970sâˆ’1990s trends become non-significant and highly variable, which comes into play in some regions earlier than others. This further reflects the dominating influence of internal climate variability over heatwaves on multi-decadal timescales20,23, even over more recent periods where the most amount of global warming has occurred22. We therefore advocate that any assessment of regional changes in heatwavesâ€”irrespective of which heatwave metric is used and/or the amount of overall warming experiencedâ€”is measured over a period of at least 3âˆ’4 decades.
It is worth noting that with the exception of MED, most regionally and globally averaged average heatwave intensity trends (Fig.Â 4c) are not significant from 1950 onwards. This is consistent with the lack of trends in average heatwave intensity discussed above. Moreover, exceptional changes in extreme temperatures over MED have been outlined in previous studies3,27,30,31. Further, globally averaged trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat are always significant until trends commence in 2000 or slightly later (Figs.Â 3c, d, 4d), since the influence of variability is averaged out over larger spatial scales.
Discussion
By employing a consistent heatwave measurement framework, our study presents the first comprehensive global and regional analysis of observed heatwave changes. Our findings demonstrate the concerning rate of heatwave increases since the mid-twentieth century. Moreover, trend magnitudes are not globally uniform, and are highest over regions known to experience disproportionately more adverse impacts of climate change5,9. While mainly significantly increasing trends since 1950 are evident for heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat, they are not monotonic. This study highlights that changes in heatwaves are not only increasing but accelerating in the presence of anthropogenic climate change. However, heatwaves are quite sensitive to internal climate variability20,23, and regional trends shorter than a few decades are generally not reliable, even if the shorter period assessed includes the most recent acceleration of overall global warming22. Our study therefore recommends a period of at least 3âˆ’4 decades to robustly assess changes in heatwaves, which is considerably longer than that proposed for average temperature trends21,32.
The cumulative heatâ€”or the extra heat experienced during heatwavesâ€”has markedly increased both globally (Fig.Â 1h) and regionally (TableÂ 1, Fig.Â 4b, d). We demonstrate this is largely driven by increases in the overall number of heatwave days, although over some regions slight increases in average intensity also contribute. Attempts to provide a measure of accumulated heat have been suggested previously19, yet ours is the first to do so at both regional and global scales for the historical record. Moreover, our measure is likely more suitable for a range of impacts, instead of just one sector19. Common metrics of heatwave intensity1,13,27,32,33â€”especially those in the climate communityâ€”either focus on a single day and therefore do not represent overall intensity changes or are hindered by averaging over a larger sample size. We therefore advocate that measures of heatwave intensity assess the extra heat generated by heatwaves, such as the metric proposed in this study.
The results of our study have important implications for all systems affected by chronic heat exposure. This is because the appropriate management and adaptation of these systems is influenced by the separate components that drive the overall change. For example, longer, slightly warmer heatwaves may require different management strategies across various sectors such as public health2,10 and energy supply8 than shorter and more intense events despite a similar change in cumulative intensity. However, more research is required on this topic. Future research should also investigate how changes in the decomposition of cumulative heatâ€”as well as overall changesâ€”filters down to impacts, as well as scrutinizing further acceleration in heatwave trends under increased anthropogenic climate change.
Methods
Data
The bulk of our analysis is based on daily maximum temperatures (Tmax) from the Berkeley Earth18 gridded global land surface temperature dataset. Berkeley Earth is a relatively new global observational product on a 1Â°â€‰Ã—â€‰1Â° latitude/longitude grid, however, since at least the 1950s has been shown to perform within the bounds of other observed temperature products. The current version dates back to 1880 and uses a new mathematical framework such that the use of short and discontinuous datasets can be maximized. Input station data are weighted based on the quality and consistency they give to the spatial network. This algorithm allows Berkeley Earth to utilize five times more stations than other gridded observed temperature products. The lack of spatiotemporal gaps, especially since 1950, as well as its comparably high resolution makes Berkeley Earth an attractive dataset for assessing observed changes in temperature extremes such as heatwaves. This study is the first to demonstrate the capability of Berkeley Earth in the context of heatwave trends.
We also employ daily maximum temperatures from the HadGHCND dataset12. HadGHCND is also a gridded temperature dataset based on station data, interpolated to a 3.75Â°â€‰Ã—â€‰2.5Â° longitude/latitude grid. Because of the different criteria underpinning HadGHCND, less stations are used, which results in a quasi-global representation of observed temperature. However, because of its stricter quality control and homogenization of input stations, as well as its use in previous studies of observed changes in heatwaves, we use HadGHCND as a reference to determine the usefulness of Berkeley Earth in assessing global changes in heatwaves. HadGHCND currently extends from 1950 to 2014, and thus the two datasets are compared over this period.
Heatwaves
We employ the Tmax heatwave definition (CTX90)1. A heatwave is detected when at least 3 consecutive days are above the 90th percentile of Tmax for each calendar day. This percentile is based on a 15-day moving window of daily maximum temperatures over 1961âˆ’1990. Initially we look at three heatwave characteristics, intensity, frequency and duration. Heatwave frequency is defined as the sum of all heatwave days, heatwave intensity as the average intensity across all heatwave days, and duration as the longest event. Each characteristic is calculated for an extended summer season (Mayâˆ’September in the Northern Hemisphere, Novemberâˆ’March in the Southern Hemisphere). All heatwaves are originally calculated at the grid box level. For regional analysis, seasonal metrics were spatially averaged according to the regional boundaries in Supplementary TableÂ 1. We also introduce a fourth metric, cumulative heat. This describes the extra heat produced by heatwaves over a given season, and is the sum of the anomaly between each heatwave day and the calendar-day 90th percentile (i.e. the heatwave threshold) across all heatwave days in that season:
where heatcum is the cumulative heat exposure, n the number of heatwave days in a season, and Tanom is the temperature anomaly relative to the calendar-day 90th percentile on a given heatwave day. This differs from previous assessments of excess heat in climate science that sum absolute temperature of days that exceed moderate extreme thresholds34. However, our metric only focuses on heatwave days1, and the use of an anomaly focuses on the excess heat experienced once the heatwave threshold is exceeded. Using absolute temperatures during a heatwave can result in inflating heat exposure to a large measure that is not meaningful, as it is the exceedance of a threshold (over a number of consecutive days that constitutes a heatwave)â€”and not the fact that temperature is experienced in generalâ€”that results in excess heat exposure and adverse impacts. Therefore, we examine the anomaly of heatwave days relative to the heatwave threshold.
At the global scale, we also calculate the average anomaly of each heatwave day per season to determine whether the contribution of each day to heatcum is changing over time:
where avganom is the average temperature anomaly across all heatwave days in a given season, and HWF is the number of heatwave days in that season8.
Also at the global scale, we assess changes in heatcum and HWF expressed as a percentage, to aid in a more direct comparison across the two metrics:
where change% is the seasonal percentage change, seasmetric is the respective heatwave metric for a given season, and metric1961âˆ’1990 is the average of the respective metric over the base period (note this is the same base period as the calendar-day 90th percentile, from which heatwaves are calculated).
Trend calculations
Decadal trends were calculated via Senâ€™s Kendal slope estimator35, which is nonparametric and robust against outliers. Statistical significance was computed at the 5% level. Trends were calculated when at least 70% of daily temperature data were present per grid box, 9 years of which occurred after 2000. This condition is especially important for HadGHCND, which has inconsistencies in space and time for the period analysed, and where underpinning stations for some regions are no longer used after the new millennium. For comparison across datasets, trends are calculated between 1950 and 2014. The rest of analysis which only considers Berkeley Earth has trends calculated for 1950âˆ’2017. At the regional level, trends were calculated commencing each year between 1950 and 2000. Since only Berkeley Earth was used for regional analysis, all regional trends truncate in 2017.

Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nReal-world time-travel experiment shows ecosystem collapse due to anthropogenic climate change\nGuandong Li, TorbjÃ¶rn E.

Carrivick, â€_ Alexis J. Comber\nIntroduction\nDefined as prolonged periods of excessive heat1, heatwaves are a specific type of extreme temperature event. There are many adverse impacts of heatwaves, including on human health2, agriculture3,4, workplace productivity5, wildfire frequency and intensity6, and public infrastructure7,8. The inequality of heatwave impacts has been assessed5,9, adversely affecting developing nations due to a lack of adaptive capacity, as well as varying cultural constraints. These impacts will increase under enhanced global warming, where more rapid heatwave trends will likely produce more severe and possibly irreversible impacts in some sectors9,10,11,12.\nThere are multiple characteristics to heatwaves, including their intensity, frequency, duration, timing and spatial extent. Additionally, there are numerous ways to define each characteristic, a likely consequence of their expansive impacts as well as potential limitations of the datasets from which they are assessed. There is a general consensus that the intensity, frequency and duration of heatwaves have increased in the observational record, both regionally and globally1,13,14,15,16,17. However, all relevant studies have employed diverse metrics, analysed a subset of heatwave characteristics over selected regions, and/or used different extreme thresholds over varying time periods. This undermines a comprehensive understanding of how heatwaves have changed at regional and global scales. An all-inclusive and consistent assessment is imperative for establishing confidence in the general consensus suggested by previous disparate studies, as well as being an integral component in accurately assessing the occurrence of and changes in heatwave impacts.\nThis study provides such an assessment. While data availability limits our analysis to begin in 1950, we find that trends in the spatially consistent Berkeley Earth18 observational dataset match well with common regions between the previously used quasi-global HadGHCND19 dataset and Berkeley Earth is thus useful in furthering our understanding of global and regional changes in heatwaves. Heatwave frequency demonstrates the most significant increase across almost all regions, with nowhere experiencing a significant decrease. While average heatwave intensity displays little change, cumulative heatwave intensity increases at a similar rate to heatwave frequency. Moreover, the most intense heatwave seasons as defined by cumulative intensity generally occur post 2000. By assessing regional trends that commence from all years between 1950 and 2000, we find that the increasing trends of historical heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative intensity have accelerated over many regions. However, climate variability can be a large influence on heatwave trends over timescales of multiple decades, even in recent decades, which are more heavily influenced by enhanced anthropogenic climate change.\nResults\nGlobal trends in heatwave characteristics\nA previous attempt to address global observed heatwave changes13 employed the HadGHCND19 dataset and computed trends for 1950âˆ’2011. Although a plethora of metrics exist, we define heatwaves using a consistent methodological framework1. This is when at least 3 consecutive days are above a percentile-based extreme threshold over a 5-month warm season (see â€œMethodsâ€). We assess changes in heatwave frequency, duration and intensity, and also trends in seasonal cumulative heat, briefly expressed as the sum of the temperature anomaly relative to the respective heatwave threshold, across all heatwave days within the season (see â€œMethodsâ€ for more detailed explanations of heatwave characteristics). The cumulative heat metric provides additional and relevant information for impacts12 that is presented here at global and regional scales, alongside the more traditional heatwave metrics used in climate-based studies.\nWe primarily focus on the Berkeley Earth observational dataset18 (see â€œMethodsâ€) and analyse trends both globally and over the Special Report on Extremes (SREX) regions11 (see Supplementary TableÂ\xa01). To explore the validity of Berkeley Earth in measuring heatwave trends, we compare the two datasets (Fig.Â\xa01) for heatwave frequency (Fig. 1a, b), duration (Fig. 1c, d), intensity (Fig. 1e, f) and cumulative heat (Fig. 1g, h; see â€œMethodsâ€) where trends span 1950âˆ’2014. Note that HadGHCND can only produce a quasi-global assessment of heatwave changes, due to large amounts of missing data over Central and South America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, northern Canada and Greenland, inhibiting a true assessment of observed heatwave changes. In addition, the coarse resolution of 3.75Â° longitude by 2.5Â° latitude grid hampers an assessment of heatwave changes at the scales useful for understanding impacts. On the other hand, over the same time period Berkeley Earth provides much greater spatial coverage at a finer resolution (1Â° longitude by 1Â° latitude). Although the methods for constructing Berkeley Earth differ from HadGHCND, there is high agreement of the magnitude and significance of heatwave trends for common regions (Fig.Â\xa01). Agreement also occurs for trends commencing in subsequent decades (see Supplementary Figs.Â\xa01âˆ’4). Despite which year heatwave trends commence, the level of agreement between the datasets remains high. Moreover, while trend magnitudes generally increase through time the significance decreases, due to the increasing influence of climate variability on heatwaves over shorter timescales20,21, which is reflected by both datasets.\nTrends in seasonal heatwave days (a, b); length of longest heatwave (c, d); average heatwave intensity (e, f); and cumulative heat (g, h) for quasi-global observational dataset HadGHCND (a, c, e, g) and global observational dataset Berkeley Earth (b, d, f, h) over the period 1950âˆ’2014. Trends are expressed as days decadeâˆ’1 for (aâˆ’d), and Â°C decadeâˆ’1 for (eâˆ’h).\nAccording to Berkeley Earth, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most widespread and significant increase of the characteristics analysed (Fig.Â\xa01b). Heatwave duration (Fig.Â\xa01d), although increasing, has significant trends restricted to South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia. Significant heatwave intensity trends (Fig.Â\xa01f) are non-existent for most of the globe, the exception being southern Australia and small areas of Africa and South America. On the other hand, significant cumulative heat trends (Fig.Â\xa01h) are comparable in space to heatwave frequency (Fig.Â\xa01b), with mainly positive magnitudes. The largest trends are seen over the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, where the extra heat produced by heatwaves is increasing by 10â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1. For most other areas with significant trends, cumulative heat increases by 2âˆ’6â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1.\nRegional trends in heatwave characteristics\nOur employment of Berkeley Earth allows for the first comprehensive assessment of regional changes in observed heatwaves (TableÂ\xa01, Supplementary TableÂ\xa02), where adequate data exist for almost all of the 26 SREX regions (see â€œMethodsâ€, exception is Canada, Greenland, Iceland; CGI). During 1950âˆ’2017 (TableÂ\xa01), the largest trends were mainly over low-latitude regions. At least one extra heatwave day has occurred each decade over the majority of regions between 1950 and 2017 (though this can be as high as 3âˆ’5 days decadeâˆ’1 over low-latitude areas), and heatwaves have increased in length by between 0.2 to over 1 day decadeâˆ’1. In general, regional trends beginning in a later decade can be larger in magnitude (Supplementary TableÂ\xa02), which is at least in part due to greater overall warming of the global climate in later decades22. However later regional trends also bare less significance (Supplementary TableÂ\xa02, Figs.Â\xa03c, d, 4d), due to the influence of internal climate variability at shorter timescales20,23. Only one region (Central North America; CNA) shows no significant change for all heatwave characteristics. These trends are in line with other reported temperature changes over this region24,25.\nWhile regional trends in heatwave frequency, maximum duration, and cumulative heat are mostly significantly increasing (exception is CNA, see above), trends in average intensity are only significant for regions Amazon (AMZ), Mediterranean (MED), North East Brazil (NEB), Southeast South America (SSA) and West Asia (WAS). Nine regions, as well as the global average, have slightly decreasing (though non-significant) trends in average intensity. Therefore, it is unlikely that the regional changes in average intensity are responsible for larger, more significant increases in cumulative heat.\nAlthough mostly insignificant, trends in average intensity are smaller (or as mentioned above, even decreased) for most regions than global warming over the same time period (0.1â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1 since 1950)26. By itself, this result is not entirely surprising since the heatwave definition used here is based on a fixed threshold (see â€œMethodsâ€); thus, average intensity is inversely proportional to the number of heatwave days. Therefore, as the number of heatwave days increase (Fig.Â\xa01b, TableÂ\xa01), little or no change in average intensity can be expected. However, measuring heatwave intensity in this manner does not address the fact that more heatwaves mean more overall exposure to extreme temperatures. Indeed, other well-used measures of heatwave intensity such as the hottest heatwave day1,13,27â€”which generally have more significant trends than average intensityâ€”also do not account for this. Our assessment of cumulative heat fills this gap. Consistent with global changes (Fig.Â\xa01h), regional changes in cumulative heat have increased since 1950. Trends range from ~1â€‰Â°C to 4.5â€‰Â°C decadeâˆ’1 and are significant for all but one region (CNA, discussed above). This demonstrates that the integration of anomalies over heatwave days (see â€œMethodsâ€) has resulted in a substantial increase in the overall extreme heat experienced during heatwaves across almost every region. This is a concern in regard to the many adverse heatwave impacts, where greater overall exposure bears more influence than changes in the intensity of a specific heatwave day, or the overall average2,5,7,8,9,19,28,29.\nCumulative heat analysis\nThe highest amount of cumulative heat across all heatwaves for a given season varies regionally (Fig.Â\xa02a). For example, around an extra 80â€‰Â°C of heat was experienced during the worst heatwave season over Australia, whereas over 240â€‰Â°C of extra heat was felt during western Russiaâ€™s worst season (Fig.Â\xa02a). The Mediterranean and Siberia have both experienced seasons where heatwaves contributed an extra 200â€‰Â°C, and Alaska experienced its worst season where 150â€‰Â°C extra heat was contributed (Fig.Â\xa02a). Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the worldâ€™s worst heatwave seasons as measured by cumulative heat have occurred since 2000, with the vast majority occurring since the 1980s (Fig.Â\xa02b).\nThe highest seasonal cumulative heat (sum of anomalies relative to the calendar-day 90th percentile) (a); the year in which this value occurs (b); decadal trends in the percentage change of cumulative heat (c) and heatwave days (d); the average anomaly of a heatwave day (e) and the respective decadal trend (f). All values are calculated for the global observational dataset Berkeley Earth, for 1950âˆ’2017.\nCumulative heat is the product of all seasonal heatwave days (i.e. heatwave frequency) and average heatwave intensity (see â€œMethodsâ€). Thus, it is worth noting that the pattern and magnitude of trends in cumulative heat (Fig.Â\xa02c) looks very similar to that of heatwave frequency (Fig.Â\xa02d), when both characteristics are presented as percentage change (see â€œMethodsâ€). Significant trends are biggest over northern South America, the Middle East, the Maritime Continent and much of Africa, at 50% decadeâˆ’1. However, significant trends between 10 and 30% decadeâˆ’1 exist over most other regions.\nThe average anomaly a given heatwave day contributes to cumulative heat shows a noteworthy latitudinal gradient (Fig.Â\xa02e). Heatwave days in high latitudes contribute, on average, 2âˆ’3â€‰Â°C of extra heat dayâˆ’1 during a heatwave. In the Tropics, each heatwave day contributes between 0.5 and 1â€‰Â°C. Moreover, during 1950âˆ’2017, trends in this value are quite small with patchy significance (Fig.Â\xa02f). However, regions that display the largest trends in cumulative heat (Figs.Â\xa01h and 2c) also have a significant trend in the average contribution of a heatwave day towards cumulative heat.\nHow trends themselves are changing\nThe heatwave trends discussed thus far are long-term changes over a period with substantial inter-regional and interannual variability, and intensifying global warming (Figs.Â\xa03a, b, 4a, b); so constant trends should not be assumed. Moreover, the combination of intensifying anthropogenic influence on the global climate, and the measurable influence of internal variability on heatwaves20,23, strongly suggests that the trends themselves are not stable. However, previous assessments on the influence of internal variability on heatwaves has been limited to physical climate models20,23. For selected regions (see Supplementary TableÂ\xa01), we present trends in each heatwave metric commencing in the years 1950âˆ’2000 inclusive and truncating in 2017 (Figs.Â\xa03c, d, 4c, d).\nSelected timeseries of heatwave days (a); and length of longest heatwave (b). Decadal trends in heatwave days (c); and length of longest heatwave (d) commencing yearly between 1950 and 2000 and truncating in 2017. All values are calculated for the global observational dataset Berkeley Earth (see â€œMethodsâ€). Closed circles in (c) and (d) indicate when trends commencing in that year are NOT statistically significant at the 5% level (see â€œMethodsâ€). Regions displayed are Central North America (CNA), East Asia (EAS), Mediterranean (MED), North Asia (NAS), North Australia (NAU), North Europe (NEU), West North America (WNA), and the global average (Wor).\nSelected timeseries of average heatwave intensity (a); and cumulative heat (b). Decadal trends in average heatwave intensity (c); and cumulative heat (d) commencing yearly between 1950 and 2000 and truncating in 2017. All values are calculated for the global observational dataset Berkeley Earth (see â€œMethodsâ€). Closed circles in (c) and (d) indicate when trends commencing in that year are NOT statistically significant at the 5% level (see â€œMethodsâ€). Regions displayed are Central North America (CNA), East Asia (EAS), Mediterranean (MED), North Asia (NAS), North Australia (NAU), North Europe (NEU), West North America (WNA), and the global average (Wor).\nTrends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat (Figs.Â\xa03c, d, 4d) continue to increase in magnitude and remain significant when commencing in 1950 until at least 1970s. The exception is again CNA, where trends commencing in the early 1950s are not significant yet gain significance when commencing between the mid 1950sâˆ’1970s. This means that not only has the overall number of heatwave days, the length of the longest event and the extra heat experienced during heatwaves increased, but the speed at which these changes have occurred has accelerated during this timeframe. Note that for regions MED, WNA, East Asia (EAS), North Asia (NAS), and Northern Europe (NEU), as well as the global average, frequency and duration trends continue to accelerate up to trends commencing in the 1990s (Figs.Â\xa03c, d, 4d). Over MED, for example, heatwave frequency increases by over 2 days decadeâˆ’1 for trends commencing in 1950, accelerating to 6.4 days decadeâˆ’1 for trends commencing in the early 1980s (Fig.Â\xa03c). Acceleration of observed heatwave trends is not all that surprising given increasing global warming, and assessments of heatwave trends and individual events from climate models27,30,31.\nBy the 1970sâˆ’1990s trends become non-significant and highly variable, which comes into play in some regions earlier than others. This further reflects the dominating influence of internal climate variability over heatwaves on multi-decadal timescales20,23, even over more recent periods where the most amount of global warming has occurred22. We therefore advocate that any assessment of regional changes in heatwavesâ€”irrespective of which heatwave metric is used and/or the amount of overall warming experiencedâ€”is measured over a period of at least 3âˆ’4 decades.\nIt is worth noting that with the exception of MED, most regionally and globally averaged average heatwave intensity trends (Fig.Â\xa04c) are not significant from 1950 onwards. This is consistent with the lack of trends in average heatwave intensity discussed above. Moreover, exceptional changes in extreme temperatures over MED have been outlined in previous studies3,27,30,31. Further, globally averaged trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat are always significant until trends commence in 2000 or slightly later (Figs.Â\xa03c, d, 4d), since the influence of variability is averaged out over larger spatial scales.\nDiscussion\nBy employing a consistent heatwave measurement framework, our study presents the first comprehensive global and regional analysis of observed heatwave changes. Our findings demonstrate the concerning rate of heatwave increases since the mid-twentieth century. Moreover, trend magnitudes are not globally uniform, and are highest over regions known to experience disproportionately more adverse impacts of climate change5,9. While mainly significantly increasing trends since 1950 are evident for heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat, they are not monotonic. This study highlights that changes in heatwaves are not only increasing but accelerating in the presence of anthropogenic climate change. However, heatwaves are quite sensitive to internal climate variability20,23, and regional trends shorter than a few decades are generally not reliable, even if the shorter period assessed includes the most recent acceleration of overall global warming22. Our study therefore recommends a period of at least 3âˆ’4 decades to robustly assess changes in heatwaves, which is considerably longer than that proposed for average temperature trends21,32.\nThe cumulative heatâ€”or the extra heat experienced during heatwavesâ€”has markedly increased both globally (Fig.Â\xa01h) and regionally (TableÂ\xa01, Fig.Â\xa04b, d). We demonstrate this is largely driven by increases in the overall number of heatwave days, although over some regions slight increases in average intensity also contribute. Attempts to provide a measure of accumulated heat have been suggested previously19, yet ours is the first to do so at both regional and global scales for the historical record. Moreover, our measure is likely more suitable for a range of impacts, instead of just one sector19. Common metrics of heatwave intensity1,13,27,32,33â€”especially those in the climate communityâ€”either focus on a single day and therefore do not represent overall intensity changes or are hindered by averaging over a larger sample size. We therefore advocate that measures of heatwave intensity assess the extra heat generated by heatwaves, such as the metric proposed in this study.\nThe results of our study have important implications for all systems affected by chronic heat exposure. This is because the appropriate management and adaptation of these systems is influenced by the separate components that drive the overall change. For example, longer, slightly warmer heatwaves may require different management strategies across various sectors such as public health2,10 and energy supply8 than shorter and more intense events despite a similar change in cumulative intensity. However, more research is required on this topic. Future research should also investigate how changes in the decomposition of cumulative heatâ€”as well as overall changesâ€”filters down to impacts, as well as scrutinizing further acceleration in heatwave trends under increased anthropogenic climate change.\nMethods\nData\nThe bulk of our analysis is based on daily maximum temperatures (Tmax) from the Berkeley Earth18 gridded global land surface temperature dataset. Berkeley Earth is a relatively new global observational product on a 1Â°â€‰Ã—â€‰1Â° latitude/longitude grid, however, since at least the 1950s has been shown to perform within the bounds of other observed temperature products. The current version dates back to 1880 and uses a new mathematical framework such that the use of short and discontinuous datasets can be maximized. Input station data are weighted based on the quality and consistency they give to the spatial network. This algorithm allows Berkeley Earth to utilize five times more stations than other gridded observed temperature products. The lack of spatiotemporal gaps, especially since 1950, as well as its comparably high resolution makes Berkeley Earth an attractive dataset for assessing observed changes in temperature extremes such as heatwaves. This study is the first to demonstrate the capability of Berkeley Earth in the context of heatwave trends.\nWe also employ daily maximum temperatures from the HadGHCND dataset12. HadGHCND is also a gridded temperature dataset based on station data, interpolated to a 3.75Â°â€‰Ã—â€‰2.5Â° longitude/latitude grid. Because of the different criteria underpinning HadGHCND, less stations are used, which results in a quasi-global representation of observed temperature. However, because of its stricter quality control and homogenization of input stations, as well as its use in previous studies of observed changes in heatwaves, we use HadGHCND as a reference to determine the usefulness of Berkeley Earth in assessing global changes in heatwaves. HadGHCND currently extends from 1950 to 2014, and thus the two datasets are compared over this period.\nHeatwaves\nWe employ the Tmax heatwave definition (CTX90)1. A heatwave is detected when at least 3 consecutive days are above the 90th percentile of Tmax for each calendar day. This percentile is based on a 15-day moving window of daily maximum temperatures over 1961âˆ’1990. Initially we look at three heatwave characteristics, intensity, frequency and duration. Heatwave frequency is defined as the sum of all heatwave days, heatwave intensity as the average intensity across all heatwave days, and duration as the longest event. Each characteristic is calculated for an extended summer season (Mayâˆ’September in the Northern Hemisphere, Novemberâˆ’March in the Southern Hemisphere). All heatwaves are originally calculated at the grid box level. For regional analysis, seasonal metrics were spatially averaged according to the regional boundaries in Supplementary TableÂ\xa01. We also introduce a fourth metric, cumulative heat. This describes the extra heat produced by heatwaves over a given season, and is the sum of the anomaly between each heatwave day and the calendar-day 90th percentile (i.e. the heatwave threshold) across all heatwave days in that season:\nwhere heatcum is the cumulative heat exposure, n the number of heatwave days in a season, and Tanom is the temperature anomaly relative to the calendar-day 90th percentile on a given heatwave day. This differs from previous assessments of excess heat in climate science that sum absolute temperature of days that exceed moderate extreme thresholds34. However, our metric only focuses on heatwave days1, and the use of an anomaly focuses on the excess heat experienced once the heatwave threshold is exceeded. Using absolute temperatures during a heatwave can result in inflating heat exposure to a large measure that is not meaningful, as it is the exceedance of a threshold (over a number of consecutive days that constitutes a heatwave)â€”and not the fact that temperature is experienced in generalâ€”that results in excess heat exposure and adverse impacts. Therefore, we examine the anomaly of heatwave days relative to the heatwave threshold.\nAt the global scale, we also calculate the average anomaly of each heatwave day per season to determine whether the contribution of each day to heatcum is changing over time:\nwhere avganom is the average temperature anomaly across all heatwave days in a given season, and HWF is the number of heatwave days in that season8.\nAlso at the global scale, we assess changes in heatcum and HWF expressed as a percentage, to aid in a more direct comparison across the two metrics:\nwhere change% is the seasonal percentage change, seasmetric is the respective heatwave metric for a given season, and metric1961âˆ’1990 is the average of the respective metric over the base period (note this is the same base period as the calendar-day 90th percentile, from which heatwaves are calculated).\nTrend calculations\nDecadal trends were calculated via Senâ€™s Kendal slope estimator35, which is nonparametric and robust against outliers. Statistical significance was computed at the 5% level. Trends were calculated when at least 70% of daily temperature data were present per grid box, 9 years of which occurred after 2000. This condition is especially important for HadGHCND, which has inconsistencies in space and time for the period analysed, and where underpinning stations for some regions are no longer used after the new millennium. For comparison across datasets, trends are calculated between 1950 and 2014. The rest of analysis which only considers Berkeley Earth has trends calculated for 1950âˆ’2017. At the regional level, trends were calculated commencing each year between 1950 and 2000. Since only Berkeley Earth was used for regional analysis, all regional trends truncate in 2017.\nData availability\nThe data underpinning this study are publicly available under the following DOIs: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12017847; https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12017838; https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12017811.

This year is setting up to be a momentous year in the movement for climate action. Scroll through your newsfeed, scan the day's headlines, and chances are you'll see something about climate change.
This is good news. Largely because, as the latest IPCC report published in March made extremely clear, we are out of time for talking. We have to see urgent and widespread action on climate change right now — and that means global, systemic transformation.
But it can get overwhelming. Both in terms of eco-anxiety — an international study in 2021 revealed that 60% of young people were very worried about climate change — but also in terms of the sheer amount of information to know.
International climate policy isn’t exactly taught in school (although many, such as activist Scarlett Westbrook, argue it should be) and a barrage of media stories might have left you wondering what the difference is between your ""net zero"", your “NDCs”, and your “nature-based solutions.”
So to help, here’s a handy glossary of all the climate-related words and phrases you should know about.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns within global or regional climate patterns. The main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels — such as coal, oil, and gas — to produce energy and power transport.
In addition to other human activities, like cutting down forests and farming, this releases heat-trapping pollution (called greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere, warming the planet and destabilizing the climate.
Climate change is already having a devastating impact on people all around the world, particularly through extreme weather events like heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, droughts, and floods. Climate change is also disproportionately impacting the world's poorest people and nations the most, despite these populations having contributed the least to climate change.
The climate crisis refers to the urgent need for immediate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and address the causes of climate change, and prevent serious and permanent damage to the environment.
Global warming refers to a long-term warming of the Earth’s surface overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Human activity has played a huge role in the increase of our planet’s temperature. Burning fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gases, which cause what's known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere — which locks heat into the earth's atmosphere and causes the average global temperature to rise.
Learn more about global warming and its causes and effects in our explainer here.
Fossil fuel is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources such as coal, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from dead plants and animals that existed millions of years ago, and can also be made by industrial processes from other fossil fuels.
When fossil fuels are burned they release harmful gases into the atmosphere and cause global warming (see above!). Fossil fuels currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy.
Debates about climate policy often refer to the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where did this limit come from, and why?
It refers to how we are tracking the world’s temperature in comparison to pre-industrial temperatures. The world is already 1.2C degrees warmer, and we’re seeing changes in weather and the climate as a result.
The idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body founded in 1988 to regularly assess all the available science on the changing global climate. Scientific predictions have been made about what the likely effect of incremental temperature rises would be — you can read about the differences between a 1.5, 2, and 3 degree rise here.
The Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015 committed all 196 countries that signed it to endeavoring to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees.
Loss and damage is a phrase you'll likely hear a lot, and it refers, to quote the UN Environment Program, ""to the negative consequences that arise from the unavoidable risks of climate change"" — things like, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more. There's no internationally agreed definition for loss and damage, but it typically refers to the destructive impacts of climate change.
When capitalized, Loss and Damage is typically used when referring to international climate negotiations and the plans and policies that address loss and damage. Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.
It’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.
With sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.
Climate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.
Dedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change's impacts.
In short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.
It is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.
At the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.
Find out more here about climate finance here.
Nature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.
These are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.
Forests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.
The goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”
That’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.
Net zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.
A number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.
Climate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.
It acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently — with the world's poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change — and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.
Renewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.
Extreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns — and it's becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we've witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.
Carbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).
The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.
It has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.
Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren't money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.
In a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.
The world’s biggest climate summit is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.
The COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.
The summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.
COP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”
Something that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.
These plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.
Currently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.
A climate refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It's estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.
There are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.
SIDS —  Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10. AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.

Scroll through your newsfeed, scan the day\'s headlines, and chances are you\'ll see something about climate change.\nThis is good news. Largely because, as the latest IPCC report published in March made extremely clear, we are out of time for talking. We have to see urgent and widespread action on climate change right now — and that means global, systemic transformation.\nBut it can get overwhelming. Both in terms of eco-anxiety — an international study in 2021 revealed that 60% of young people were very worried about climate change — but also in terms of the sheer amount of information to know.\nInternational climate policy isn’t exactly taught in school (although many, such as activist Scarlett Westbrook, argue it should be) and a barrage of media stories might have left you wondering what the difference is between your ""net zero"", your “NDCs”, and your “nature-based solutions.”\nSo to help, here’s a handy glossary of all the climate-related words and phrases you should know about.\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns within global or regional climate patterns.\xa0The main cause of climate change is\xa0burning fossil fuels\xa0— such as coal, oil, and gas — to produce energy and power transport.\nIn addition to other human activities, like cutting down forests and farming, this releases heat-trapping pollution\xa0(called greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere, warming the planet\xa0and destabilizing the climate.\nClimate change is already having a devastating impact on people all around the world, particularly through extreme weather events like heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, droughts, and floods. Climate change is also disproportionately impacting the world\'s poorest people and nations the most, despite these populations having contributed the least to climate change.\nThe climate crisis refers to the urgent need for immediate action\xa0to mitigate the impacts of climate change and address the causes of climate change,\xa0and prevent serious and permanent damage to the environment.\nGlobal warming refers to a long-term warming of the Earth’s surface overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.\nHuman activity has played a huge role in the increase of our planet’s temperature.\xa0Burning fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gases, which\xa0cause what\'s known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere\xa0— which locks heat into the earth\'s atmosphere and causes the average global temperature to rise.\nLearn more about global warming and its causes and effects in our explainer here.\nFossil fuel is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources\xa0such as coal, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from dead plants and animals that existed millions of years ago, and can also be made by industrial processes\xa0from other fossil fuels.\nWhen fossil fuels are burned they release harmful gases into the atmosphere and cause global warming (see above!). Fossil fuels currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy.\nDebates about climate policy often refer to the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where did this limit come from, and why?\nIt refers to how we are tracking the world’s temperature in comparison to pre-industrial temperatures. The world is already 1.2C degrees warmer, and we’re seeing changes in weather and the climate as a result.\nThe idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body founded in 1988 to regularly assess all the available science on the changing global climate. Scientific predictions have been made about what the likely effect of incremental temperature rises would be — you can read about the differences between a 1.5, 2, and 3 degree rise here.\nThe Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015 committed all 196 countries that signed it to endeavoring to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees.\nLoss and damage is a phrase you\'ll likely hear a lot, and it refers, to quote the UN Environment Program, ""to the negative consequences that arise from the unavoidable risks of climate change"" — things like, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more. There\'s no internationally agreed definition for loss and damage, but it typically refers to the destructive impacts of climate change.\nWhen capitalized, Loss and Damage is typically used when referring to international climate negotiations and the plans and policies that address loss and damage. Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.\nIt’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.\nWith sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.\nClimate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.\nDedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change\'s impacts.\nIn short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.\nIt is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.\nAt the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.\nFind out more here about climate finance here.\nNature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.\nThese are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs\xa0to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.\nForests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.\nThe goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”\nThat’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.\nNet zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.\nA number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.\nClimate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.\nIt acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently\xa0— with the world\'s poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change —\xa0and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.\nRenewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.\nExtreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns\xa0— and it\'s becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we\'ve witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.\nCarbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere\xa0and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).\nThe Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries\xa0at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.\nIt has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.\nBiodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren\'t\xa0money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.\nIn a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.\nThe world’s biggest climate summit\xa0is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.\nThe COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.\nThe summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.\nCOP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”\nSomething that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit\xa0their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.\nThese plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.\nCurrently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report\xa0by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.\nA climate refugee is a person who has been\xa0forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas\xa0given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It\'s estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.\nThere are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.\nSIDS — \xa0Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10.\xa0AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.\nNow you know all about the key words and phrases relating to climate change, you can join us and Global Citizen around the world in taking action to address climate change.

Abstract
Using data from Twitter (now X), this study deploys artificial intelligence (AI) and network analysis toÂ map and profile climate change denialism across the United States. We estimate that 14.8% of Americans do not believe in climate change. This denialism is highest in the central and southern U.S. However, it also persists in clusters within states (e.g., California) where belief in climate change is high. Political affiliation has the strongest correlation, followed by level of education, COVID-19 vaccination rates, carbon intensity of the regional economy, and income. The analysis reveals how a coordinated social media network uses periodic events, such as cold weather and climate conferences, to sow disbelief about climate change and science, in general. Donald Trump was the strongest influencer in this network, followed by conservative media outlets and right-wing activists. As a form of knowledge vulnerability, climate denialism renders communities unprepared to take steps to increase resilience. As
with other forms of misinformation, social media companies (e.g., X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok) should flag accounts that spread falsehoods about climate change and collaborate on targeted educational campaigns.
Introduction
Climate change denialism persists in the United States, with estimates ranging from 12% to 26% of the U.S. population1,2. It is more pronounced in some states and regions3. Reasons for this denialism are multifaceted: Political affiliation and ideology, income, education, and exposure to extreme weather events areÂ all important factors4,5,6. Denialism is more prevalent where local economies are highly dependent on fossil fuels7, in rural communities, and in populations where mistrust in science is pronounced8,9. Social media reaches millions of users, providing a key mechanism for influencers to spread misinformation10. The ability of social media to influence and harden attitudes was apparent in the response to COVID-19 vaccines11.
Understanding how and why climate change opinion varies geographically and documenting it at an actionable scale is crucial for communication campaigns, outreach, and other interventions12,13. Most estimates of the extent and geographic configuration of climate change denialism rely primarily on national surveys, with the Yale Climate Opinion Survey being the only dataset that provides estimates at the state and county levels for the entire U.S.3. These survey efforts, however, are time-intensive and expensive and are therefore destined to cover short time spans and, often, limited geographic extent. The Yale Survey combines data from more than 2500 national surveys and uses multinomial regression modeling to downscale estimates to subnational levels. Independent representative surveys conducted in states and metropolitan areas validate the predictions from the Yale Survey models3.
Mining social media data (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, and X, formerly Twitter) is a tantalizing alternative to survey-based approaches14,15. X is a social media platform with an extensive data repository. By adjusting for the skew toward certain demographic groups in users, data from this platform is useful for estimating public views on an array of topics, such as politics, social issues, and COVID-19 vaccination rates16,17. Data from Twitter has also been used in predictive modeling of election outcomes18. Account holders can misuse it to oppose scientific knowledge and spread misinformation19.
This study used Twitter data (2017â€“2019) to: (i) estimate the prevalence of climate change denialism at the state and county levels; (ii) identify typical profiles of climate change deniers; (iii) understand how social media promulgates climate change denialism through key influencers; and (iv) determine how world events are leveraged to promulgate attitudesÂ about climate change.
We used a Deep Learning text recognition model to classify 7.4 million geocoded tweets containing keywords related to climate change. Posted by 1.3 million unique users in the U.S.,Â theseÂ tweets wereÂ collected between September 2017 and May 2019 (see Online Methods S1). We classified these tweets about climate change into â€˜forâ€™ (belief) and â€˜againstâ€™ (denial). Our analysis resulted in a profile of climate change deniers at the county level, providedÂ insight into the networks of social media figures influential in promoting climate change denial, and generated insight intoÂ how these influencers use current events to foster this denial.
After confirming the validity of using social media data instead of information collected through surveys to capture public opinion on climate change at policy-relevant geographical scales, we found that denialism clusters in particular regions (and counties) of the country and amongst certain socio-demographic groups. Our analysis reveals how politicians, media figures, and conservative activists promulgated misinformation in the Twittersphere. It maps out how denialists and climate change believers haveÂ formed mostly separate Twitter communities, creating echo chambers. Such information provides a basis for developing strategies to counter this knowledge vulnerability and reduce the spread of mis- or disinformation by targeting the communities most at risk of not adopting measaures to increase resilience to the effects of climate change.
Results
Where in the U.S. is climate change denial prevalent?
Our study found that 14.8% of Americans deny that climate change is real (Fig.Â 1A), a percentage consistent with previous national studies (Fig. S4). Using geolocation information, we determined that denialism is highest in the Central part of the U.S. and in the South, with more than 20% of the populations of OK, MS, AL, and ND consisting of deniers. Along the West and East Coasts and New England, belief in climate change is highest. However, climate change denial varies substantially within states, often clustering in geographic swaths across multiple counties (Fig.Â 1B). For example, in Shasta County, California climate change denial is as high as 52%; yet overall less than 12% of the population of California does not believe in climate change. Similarly, the average percentage of deniers is 21% in Texas, butÂ at the county-levelÂ this ranges from 13% in Travis County to 67% in Hockley County.
Climate change denialism in the United States, by state (A) and county (B). Note:Â Figure created using QGIS 3.30 (https://www.qgis.org/).
To validate these results, we compared them to the Yale Climate Opinion Surveys at the national, state, and county levels (Fig. S5). The mean absolute difference between the two models was three percentage points (S.D.â€‰=â€‰2.7), with the Twitter data yielding a higher percentage of deniers (Fig. S5A). Compared to the Yale Survey, our model showed higher proportions of deniers in Southern states (for example, MS, AL, TN, and TX). However, state-level and county-level percentages of believers and deniers were highly correlated between the two datasets (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) (Fig. S5Bâ€“E).
What type of people are climate change deniers?
We performed bivariate correlation analysis with data from multiple publicly available sources (see Online Methods S1)
to characterize climate change deniers (Table 1). We evaluated the following characteristics of populations in those regions that were associated with the Twitter profiles for a positive or negative correlation with climate change denial: Political affiliation, race, income, education level, COVID-19 vaccination rates (proxy for belief in science in general), degree ofÂ carbon-intensity of the regional economy, degree of urbanization (county-level), and local weather patterns (Table 1). At both the county and state levels, populations with a high percentage of Republican voters had the strongest correlation with climate change deniers. Carbon dependency of the economy was also significantly high at the state level. The strongest negative correlations (at both state and county levels) were level of education and COVID-19 vaccination rates. Integrating these data into a weighted least squares regression model, we defined a profile of a ""typical"" climate change denier (Table 2). This was the typicalÂ profile : Republican, with no college degree and without COVID-19 vaccination living in a region with a high average annual temperature.
To gain additional insight into the geographical relationship between denialism and political affiliation at the county level, we used the bivariate LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association) model20 to identify which counties with high rates of denialism or belief were spatially associated with high rates of Republican or Democratic voters. Clusters of deniers that coincided with high rates of Republican voters were spatially contiguous and covered large swaths of the interior West (Idaho, Montana, Wyoming), Central (Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas), and Appalachian regions (West Virginia, Tennessee) of the U.S. (Fig.Â 2). These findings are consistent with our regression modeling and bivariate correlations: these regions tend to have high rates of carbon dependency of the economy, low COVID-19Â vaccination rates, and large rural populations. Conversely, clusters of believers and high rates of Democratic voters were most prevalent along the PacificÂ Coast (California, Washington), the New England Region, the Great Lakes, and the Southwest (Arizona), as well as inÂ regionsÂ nearÂ metropolitan areas and technological hubs.

Who are climate change influencers in the Twittersphere?
To delineate how polarized opinion forms in the Twittersphere, we constructed Twitter networks (based on the 1200 most retweeted users in the sample), analyzed how users interact, and identified key influencers (Fig.Â 3). To identify closely linked users assumed to share similar views, we evaluated co-retweeting, in which a single user retweetsÂ tweets from two or more other users21. Two distinct communities emerged, a denier communityÂ and a believer community (Fig.Â 3A). The community of climate change believers (blue nodes) isÂ larger, with 1029 users andâ€‰~â€‰224,000 co-retweets, giving it a broader reach and influence on Twitter than the denier community (red nodes), which has 171 users andâ€‰~â€‰15,000 co-retweets. The proportion of deniers among the top 1200 influential users (14.3%) aligned with the national percentage of climate change deniers identified in our model (14.8%).
Influencers detected in climate change co-retweeted networks. (A) Co-retweeted networks formed by the 1200 most retweeted users in the U.S. The nodes represent unique accounts; the edges represent co-retweeted relationships. The size of nodes and the shade of the node color are proportional to their influence, as measured by eigenvector centrality scores. The high density of edges within the communities makes many individual edges not displayable. The top influencers in the community of climate change deniers (B) and believers (C) are labeled with the usernames. In panels (B) and (C), edges-to-users in the other community are not displayed.
Both believers and deniers mostly shared information and interacted within their own community. Users from the two communities were rarely co-retweeted, as illustrated by the distance between the cluster of nodes for each community and the low number of edges connecting the two communities. Amongâ€‰~â€‰230,000 co-retweets, only 4083 (<â€‰0.02%) were between users having opposite views on climate change. This low percentage of co-retweets of contrasting views highlights an echo-chamber effect. We found that a few nodes bridge the gap between the two communities, notably conservative news outlets such as Fox News and the Washington Examiner.
To identify the most influential users, we calculated the eigenvector centrality value per Twitter user. A high score means that a user was co-retweeted with many other users who also had high scores. Among climate change deniers, former U.S. President Donald Trump had the biggest influence (Fig.Â 3B). Three groups of influential deniers were heavily co-retweeted with President Trump: (i) conservative media outlets that regularly broadcast contrarian views on climate change, including alt-right news and blogs such as The Daily Wire, Daily Caller, Breitbart and thebradfordfile; (ii) mis/disinformation websites that publish misleading and false claims about climate change, including TownHall Media and the Climate Depot; andÂ (iii) right-wing producers, political commentators, and activists. Collectively, in concert with former President Trump and close colleagues, these three groups formed an organized and coordinated social media network, enabling climate change denialism to amplify and expand.
In contrast, the larger blue community is more diffuse. Politicians dominated the most influential users (Fig.Â 3C). Of the top 30 influential believers, 15 accounts belong to members of the Democratic Party, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris (Table S1). Eight of the top 30 nodes were popular media outlets, or websites, such as CNN, NBC, ABC, The Hill, The Washington Post, TheÂ New York Times. Other influential nodes included popular science communicators and entertainers advocating scientific consensus.
How does climate change-related tweeting and topic use vary over time?
To investigate the dynamics of tweeting activity for both communities and to understand how each perceived and responded to real-world events, we performed topic modeling and time series analysis of tweet volume. This analysis revealed how each group reacted selectively and opportunistically to the 17 events that occurred during the period of data collection (November 2017â€“May 2019).
Consistent with the larger size of the believer community, this community had a consistent pattern of climate change tweet activity throughout the sampling period (Fig.Â 4A). In contrast, the denier community had lower activity overall. However, both communities had periods of high activity with spikes that exceeded the average pattern. The number of these high spikes was lower for the denier community. By manually identifying events that potentially triggered these large spikes, we found that deniers and believers do not always respond to the same events. Only six events triggered higher than average tweet volume by the denier community (Table S3): three were related to extreme cold weather events, two were related to United Nations activities about climate change â€”a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and an annual meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24), and the last was an attack on climate change deniers by Bill Nye in an HBO broadcast. Intriguingly, two of the highest spikes by the believer community occurred with events associated with President Trump that sparked high activity in the denier community, suggesting that these communities tried to influence or counter each other.
Events that drive tweet volume among deniers and believers and topic prevalence for typical events. (A) Original tweet volume per day and locally weighted regression lines are plotted over time for both climate change deniers and believers. Events that sparked online discussions are labeled alongside tweet volume spikes numerically and detailed inÂ the lower left. Red bubbles denote the events that a large group of deniers were actively involved with (>â€‰1000 original tweets). The gap in November 2018 and between January and April 2019 was due to discontinued data collection. (B) Topic prevalence for typical major events22: Events 3 and 6 represent extreme cold weather events; Event 5 represents top denier influencer Donald Trump tweeting about cold weather and doubts aboutÂ global warming; Event 12 represents the Trump AdministrationÂ publicly refuting theÂ validity of the IPCC 2018 report (https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009157940); and Event 13, a UN climate change conference (COP24), represents an event that engaged both deniers and believers.
To gain further insight into whether the groups attempted to counter each other, we classified tweets of believers and deniers for these 17 events based on the five climate change narratives (seeÂ Fig.Â 4B) proposed by Cook22. Overall, the major narrative in the believer community was â€œThere is still time to adapt,""Â representing 42% of the total tweets). In contrast, deniers focused tweeting activity on the message â€œClimate change is not real,â€ as indicated by 48% of the tweets falling into this category.
Although weather events were associated with spikes in tweets from both communities, events viewed as abnormal weather caused by climate change [the California Wildfires (Event 9) and Hurricane Florence (Event 10) triggered a high volume of tweets among believers and events viewed as colder-than-expected weather [a snowstorm in Texas (Event 3) and a blizzard in the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions (Event 6) triggered a surge in tweets amongst deniers. Both colder-than-expected weather events provided an opportunity for the deniers to espouse that climate change is not real (64% of theÂ total tweets for both events), to delegitimize scientific consensus (12% ofÂ the total) and to reaffirm the claim that the changing climate is a normal geologic process andÂ to foment doubt that human activities are a source of this change (13% ofÂ the total).
Consistent with an attempt to counter each otherâ€™s messages, the December 2017 tweet by Trump casting doubt on global warming due to a blizzard (Event 5) triggered the believer community to issue tweets emphasizing that climate change is unequivocal (32% of theÂ total) and that there is clear scientific consensus (35% ofÂ the total). A common refrain among deniers was that climate change is a conspiracy theory or hoax (59% ofÂ the total) and a shadowy attempt to dupe the public into bearing the costs of decarbonization, while generating enormous wealth for Blue â€˜elitesâ€™ (9% ofÂ the total). These tweets were heavily re-tweeted by conservative media (e.g., Daily Caller), right-wing activists (e.g., Chuck Woolery), and mis/disinformation sites (e.g., Watts Up With That?) (Table S1).
Conflicting messages were also common in response to COP24, consistent with an attempt to influence opinion. Believers overwhelmingly advocated for timely collective action or promoted campaigns showcasing impacts of and solutions to climate change (50% of the total). Deniers focused on conspiracy theories (climate change is not real, 46%) or a Democratic party agenda filled withÂ impractical solutions (26%).
Study limitations
Our modeling approach has several limitations. First, X (formerly Twitter) has limited the number of posts a user can read in a day, ostensibly to prevent â€˜data scrapingâ€™ practices from unauthorized users. If this policy persists, then it will hamper research that relies on social media data to assess online beliefs and sentiment. This has implications in terms of the replicability of our modeling to other countries, time frames, and topics23,24,25. A second limitation of our modeling is that uncertainty is higher in areas with low population densities (e.g., rural areas) due to small sample sizes26. This is a well-known limitation of using social media to assess consensus and is even more pronounced in countries where use of social media is limited. To minimize this effectÂ in our study, we normalized input data by county population and employed a weighted approach using the total count of tweets as weights both for the calculation of bivariate relationships and for the regression models (see â€œMethodsâ€). Third, our classification scheme labeled tweets as either believing or denying climate change. National surveys indicate a percentage of the population (5â€“15%) who remain neutral or may not have a particular opinion on the topic27. In our binary classification, we used those climate change-related keywords that indicated a clear position (for or against) on the issue. As a portion of our sample uses sarcastic or ambivalent language that is difficult for the model to distinguish, classifying these tweets can be challenging. To address this, we calculated confidence for each prediction (see â€œMethodsâ€) to filter out those with low confidence (CIâ€‰<â€‰0.75).
Discussion
Using data from Twitter (now X), we used AI techniques and network analysis toÂ delineate a comprehensive socialÂ anatomy of climate change denialism in the U.S., at the state and county levels. We identified geographic clusters of climate change denial in Republican counties, especially rural ones, and among residents who do not have a college education. This provides critical knowledge for identifying segments of the population that would benefit from targeted efforts to expand awareness of the risks associated with climate changeÂ and strategies to increase local resilience.
The strong correlation between denialism and low COVID-19 vaccination rates indicated a broad skepticism of science generally amongst climate change deniers, which corresponds to resistance to science-based public policies such as shelter-in-place COVID-19 mandates28 or mask usage29. This finding indicates that communities with aÂ high prevalence of deniers are at risk for discounting other science-based health or safety recommendations. According to the theory of identity-protective cognition, people tend to selectively credit or discredit evidence in patterns that reflect beliefs that predominate in their group30,31. This theory helps explain why those who vote Republican are more likely to believe tweets from former President Trump regarding climate change than from other sources; it is identity affirming.
Classifying tweets based on the Cookâ€™s five categories22 enables identification of commonly deployed rhetorical strategies to promote climate misinformation, and in science denialism more broadly32. In our 7.3 million tweet sample, these techniques included fake experts, who have possessed little to no expertise about the underlying science but nonetheless conveyed messages that cast doubt. They serve as a credible messenger in which someone shares the same moral values and uses language consistent with existing beliefs12,33. One such example is the tweet by the Trump Administration casting doubts on the IPCC 2018 Climate Report, which was retweeted heavily by supporters. Then there are logical fallacies, such as a tweet by Trump questioning global warming because of an unusual cold weather event that went viral34. Other common strategies include impossible expectations as well as cherry picking to attack climate change science and scientists.
Combating misinformation requires effective refutation strategies35. Deploying such strategies onÂ social media sites such as X, however, is challenging as denier and believer communities are isolated from each other, leading to echo chambers19. Only 0.02% of the co-retweets about climate change were between users having opposing views. Consequently, this leads one to conclude that believers have limited ability to reach deniers through the social media platform. One strategy is to label denialism tweets as misinformation. However, some evidence suggests that this can strengthen opposition rather than change attitudes36. Another option is to flag accounts that disseminate misinformation or dangerous information. For example, then-Twitter banned Donald Trump (his account has since been restored) from using the site because of tweets maintaining election fraud and supporting the January 6 capital riots37. Twitter also banned accounts for spreading COVID-19 misinformation and calling for violence against media38. As with COVID-19, climate change is a humanitarian crisis that will affect millions, albeit at a more elongated temporal scale. Based on current policy, X (formerly Twitter) does not appear to be imposing account bans or suspensions for promoting climate change denialism. This, and related policy changes associated with new ownership of the social media platform, may make it even more susceptible to the spread of misinformation.
Communities face increasing risks related to climate change, such as flooding, wildfire, heat stress, and sea-level rise. The scientific community has already identified especially vulnerable communities and regions39. Climate change denialism is also a risk, in the form of knowledge vulnerability. Those who discount climate change as a natural rather than human-induced process tend to underestimate their current (and future) risk to it. This renders them less likely to take necessary steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
Methods
Opinion data
As primary data, we used an open access dataset created by George Washington University that is available from the GWU Libraries Dataverse40. This dataset was created using the Twitter Stream API and containsâ€‰~â€‰40 million tweets related to climate change and global warming. It covers a two-year period from September 2017 to May 2019. We initially retrievedâ€‰~â€‰27.3 million raw tweets based on tweet IDs. Theâ€‰~â€‰30% loss of tweets was due to deleted or inactive accounts since 2019.
To extract tweets located in the U.S., we developed a rule based on the geo-attributes in the raw data. We extracted the self-reported location information in an account profile. A large proportion of users (>â€‰73%) provided the location information in our dataset. To standardize the addresses and improve the geocoding process, we first transformed all the user locations to lower case and removed the URL links, emojis, punctuation marks, and other non-ASCII characters. Next, we extracted all the unique user locations (~â€‰640,000 â€œcleanâ€ addresses) and standardized all the U.S. state and city abbreviations. As a final step, we manually inspected and removed national level and obviously fake user locations.
After the preprocessing, we used the Nominatim API server to geocode user locations based on the OpenStreetMap database41. We removed locations outside the U.S., and classified addresses within the U.S. into two levels: (1) county level with tweets from users reporting their local address, city, or county; (2) state level with tweets from users reporting only the state. In the state-level tweets, we also added the aggregated county-level tweets. We then rejoined these unique U.S. addresses and the corresponding geographical coordinates to the original datasets by spatial level. The geocoding yieldedâ€‰~â€‰1.3 million unique users andâ€‰~â€‰5.2 million county-level tweets andâ€‰~â€‰7.4 million state-level tweets, from whichâ€‰~â€‰2.2 million tweets had state-level only information. To reduce the incidence of non-human accounts in our sampleÂ (i.e. tweet bots), we removed users who tweeted more than 20 times a day. Figures S1 and S2 presents the data spatial distribution and representativeness analysis.
Tweet classification
To identify climate change opinions on Twitter, we built a tweet classifier based on the Transformer, a deep learning model in the field of natural language processing42. We parameterized the model to classify tweets as either believing in the existence of climate change (predicted as â€˜forâ€™) or denying that climate change is real (predicted as â€˜againstâ€™). Instead of training a model de novo, the Transformer uses language models pre-trained on large text corpora in an unsupervised manner and then uses user-labeled training samples to fine-tune the model for specific natural language tasks. Our classifier was built upon OpenAI GPT-2, a large transformer-based language model pre-trained on a database ofâ€‰~â€‰8 million web pages43. Previous studies found that the GPT-2 model performs well in classifying short text from social media44.
We built a training dataset of manually labeled tweets to fine tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model. Labeled samples were randomly extracted only from the 1.4 million original tweets, excluding retweets and quotes. Each tweet was reviewed independently by two members of the research team and labeled as either â€˜againstâ€™ or â€˜forâ€™ climate change. In rare occasions where a tweetâ€™s message was ambiguous and there was disagreement between the two members of the research team, the tweet was excluded from the model's training data due to its potential to introduce noise to the model.
We labeled training tweets as â€˜forâ€™ or â€˜againstâ€™ climate change if they had one of the following viewpoints listed in Table 3. This labeling resulted in a balanced sample of 6,500 tweets (3300 â€˜forâ€™ tweets and 3200 â€˜againstâ€™ tweets) that we used as a training set for the model. Tweets with ambiguous messages, sarcastic language or tweets that were irrelevant to climate change were discarded from the training dataset.
Our model was built upon the Huggingface Transformers45 Library and implemented in PyTorch46. To increase the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy, we fine-tuned the parameters that resulted in an optimum learning rate at 1eâˆ’5, with dropouts at 0.1. Tweets with sarcastic, ambiguous or irrelevant messages were evaluated with the model, but the predictions based on these tweets tended to be invalid or random. To overcome this limitation, we used the Softmax function embodied in PyTorch, which calculated the prediction confidence for every individual tweet. Based on this score, we removed predictions with low confidence (CIâ€‰<â€‰0.75). The final classification was performed on the complete set of 7.4 million tweets from the collection period. We then aggregated tweets at the county and state levels and calculated percentages of â€˜againstâ€™ tweets and â€˜forâ€™ tweets as proxies of deniers and believers.
To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, we performed a series of validation tests. We manually labeled an independent validation dataset to test model accuracy. To ensure the validation dataset was balanced across the two categories and was spatially representative, we randomly extracted 30 unique original tweets from each state. Our fine-tuned model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.91 and F1 score of 0.90 (Fig. S3). Our model predictions were compared with national estimates of climate change opinion based on representative surveys, showing that our model provided a percentage for U.S. climate change deniers within the range of those determined from the surveys (Fig. S4). To validate our results at the sub-national level, we used the Yale Climate Opinion Surveys. The Yale Surveys use a downscaling statistical model based on national survey data and are the only surveys that provide climate change opinion estimates at the state and county levels. We compared these data with our model results at both state and county levels by calculatingÂ the Pearson correlationÂ coefficient. To normalize the data, we weighted the variables per population of each state and county (US Census 2018).
Correlation analysis
To examine what drives climate change opinion, we performed a series of correlation analyses. Studies have shown that climate change opinion is strongly correlated with political affiliation which is considered a major driver47,48. In addition to political ",Fox trots out same climate denial narrative for every major hurricane that hits the US,"[""It's mind blowing to me that there are people alive today that deny climate change"", 'Okay everyone let’s stop listening to Fox News and Elon Musk.  The world will be a better place if we all do this.', 'How to turn Florida blue 101.', '[removed]', 'Right wingers: stop blaming everything on climate change!

We estimate that 14.8% of Americans do not believe in climate change. This denialism is highest in the central and southern U.S. However, it also persists in clusters within states (e.g., California) where belief in climate change is high. Political affiliation has the strongest correlation, followed by level of education, COVID-19 vaccination rates, carbon intensity of the regional economy, and income. The analysis reveals how a coordinated social media network uses periodic events, such as cold weather and climate conferences, to sow disbelief about climate change and science, in general. Donald Trump was the strongest influencer in this network, followed by conservative media outlets and right-wing activists. As a form of knowledge vulnerability, climate denialism renders communities unprepared to take steps to increase resilience. As\nwith other forms of misinformation, social media companies (e.g., X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok) should flag accounts that spread falsehoods about climate change and collaborate on targeted educational campaigns.\nIntroduction\nClimate change denialism persists in the United States, with estimates ranging from 12% to 26% of the U.S. population1,2. It is more pronounced in some states and regions3. Reasons for this denialism are multifaceted: Political affiliation and ideology, income, education, and exposure to extreme weather events areÂ\xa0all important factors4,5,6. Denialism is more prevalent where local economies are highly dependent on fossil fuels7, in rural communities, and in populations where mistrust in science is pronounced8,9. Social media reaches millions of users, providing a key mechanism for influencers to spread misinformation10. The ability of social media to influence and harden attitudes was apparent in the response to COVID-19 vaccines11.\nUnderstanding how and why climate change opinion varies geographically and documenting it at an actionable scale is crucial for communication campaigns, outreach, and other interventions12,13. Most estimates of the extent and geographic configuration of climate change denialism rely primarily on national surveys, with the Yale Climate Opinion Survey being the only dataset that provides estimates at the state and county levels for the entire U.S.3. These survey efforts, however, are time-intensive and expensive and are therefore destined to cover short time spans and, often, limited geographic extent. The Yale Survey combines data from more than 2500 national surveys and uses multinomial regression modeling to downscale estimates to subnational levels. Independent representative surveys conducted in states and metropolitan areas validate the predictions from the Yale Survey models3.\nMining social media data (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, and X, formerly Twitter) is a tantalizing alternative to survey-based approaches14,15. X is a social media platform with an extensive data repository. By adjusting for the skew toward certain demographic groups in users, data from this platform is useful for estimating public views on an array of topics, such as politics, social issues, and COVID-19 vaccination rates16,17. Data from Twitter has also been used in predictive modeling of election outcomes18. Account holders can misuse it to oppose scientific knowledge and spread misinformation19.\nThis study used Twitter data (2017â€“2019) to: (i) estimate the prevalence of climate change denialism at the state and county levels; (ii) identify typical profiles of climate change deniers; (iii) understand how social media promulgates climate change denialism through key influencers; and (iv) determine how world events are leveraged to promulgate attitudesÂ\xa0about climate change.\nWe used a Deep Learning text recognition model to classify 7.4 million geocoded tweets containing keywords related to climate change. Posted by 1.3 million unique users in the U.S.,Â\xa0theseÂ\xa0tweets wereÂ\xa0collected between September 2017 and May 2019 (see Online Methods S1). We classified these tweets about climate change into â€˜forâ€™ (belief) and â€˜againstâ€™ (denial). Our analysis resulted in a profile of climate change deniers at the county level, providedÂ\xa0insight into the networks of social media figures influential in promoting climate change denial, and generated insight intoÂ\xa0how these influencers use current events to foster this denial.\nAfter confirming the validity of using social media data instead of information collected through surveys to capture public opinion on climate change at policy-relevant geographical scales, we found that denialism clusters in particular regions (and counties) of the country and amongst certain socio-demographic groups. Our analysis reveals how politicians, media figures, and conservative activists promulgated misinformation in the Twittersphere. It maps out how denialists and climate change believers haveÂ\xa0formed mostly separate Twitter communities, creating echo chambers. Such information provides a basis for developing strategies to counter this knowledge vulnerability and reduce the spread of mis- or disinformation by targeting the communities most at risk of not adopting measaures to increase resilience to the effects of climate change.\nResults\nWhere in the U.S. is climate change denial prevalent?\nOur study found that 14.8% of Americans deny that climate change is real (Fig.Â\xa01A), a percentage consistent with previous national studies (Fig. S4). Using geolocation information, we determined that denialism is highest in the Central part of the U.S. and in the South, with more than 20% of the populations of OK, MS, AL, and ND consisting of deniers. Along the West and East Coasts and New England, belief in climate change is highest. However, climate change denial varies substantially within states, often clustering in geographic swaths across multiple counties (Fig.Â\xa01B). For example, in Shasta County, California climate change denial is as high as 52%; yet overall less than 12% of the population of California does not believe in climate change. Similarly, the average percentage of deniers is 21% in Texas, butÂ\xa0at the county-levelÂ\xa0this ranges from 13% in Travis County to 67% in Hockley County.\nClimate change denialism in the United States, by state (A) and county (B). Note:Â\xa0Figure created using QGIS 3.30 (https://www.qgis.org/).\nTo validate these results, we compared them to the Yale Climate Opinion Surveys at the national, state, and county levels (Fig. S5). The mean absolute difference between the two models was three percentage points (S.D.â€‰=â€‰2.7), with the Twitter data yielding a higher percentage of deniers (Fig. S5A). Compared to the Yale Survey, our model showed higher proportions of deniers in Southern states (for example, MS, AL, TN, and TX). However, state-level and county-level percentages of believers and deniers were highly correlated between the two datasets (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) (Fig. S5Bâ€“E).\nWhat type of people are climate change deniers?\nWe performed bivariate correlation analysis with data from multiple publicly available sources (see Online Methods S1)\nto characterize climate change deniers (Table 1). We evaluated the following characteristics of populations in those regions that were associated with the Twitter profiles for a positive or negative correlation with climate change denial: Political affiliation, race, income, education level, COVID-19 vaccination rates (proxy for belief in science in general), degree ofÂ\xa0carbon-intensity of the regional economy, degree of urbanization (county-level), and local weather patterns (Table 1). At both the county and state levels, populations with a high percentage of Republican voters had the strongest correlation with climate change deniers. Carbon dependency of the economy was also significantly high at the state level. The strongest negative correlations (at both state and county levels) were level of education and COVID-19 vaccination rates. Integrating these data into a weighted least squares regression model, we defined a profile of a ""typical"" climate change denier (Table 2). This was the typicalÂ\xa0profile : Republican, with no college degree and without COVID-19 vaccination living in a region with a high average annual temperature.\nTo gain additional insight into the geographical relationship between denialism and political affiliation at the county level, we used the bivariate LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association) model20 to identify which counties with high rates of denialism or belief were spatially associated with high rates of Republican or Democratic voters. Clusters of deniers that coincided with high rates of Republican voters were spatially contiguous and covered large swaths of the interior West (Idaho, Montana, Wyoming), Central (Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas), and Appalachian regions (West Virginia, Tennessee) of the U.S. (Fig.Â\xa02). These findings are consistent with our regression modeling and bivariate correlations: these regions tend to have high rates of carbon dependency of the economy, low COVID-19Â\xa0vaccination rates, and large rural populations. Conversely, clusters of believers and high rates of Democratic voters were most prevalent along the PacificÂ\xa0Coast (California, Washington), the New England Region, the Great Lakes, and the Southwest (Arizona), as well as inÂ\xa0regionsÂ\xa0nearÂ\xa0metropolitan areas and technological hubs.\nClusters of spatial association between climate change denial and belief in relation to political affiliation. Notes:Â\xa0Figure created using QGIS 3.30 (https://www.qgis.org/). Spatial clustering analysis performed using Geoda 1.22 (https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/geoda/).\nWho are climate change influencers in the Twittersphere?\nTo delineate how polarized opinion forms in the Twittersphere, we constructed Twitter networks (based on the 1200 most retweeted users in the sample), analyzed how users interact, and identified key influencers (Fig.Â\xa03). To identify closely linked users assumed to share similar views, we evaluated co-retweeting, in which a single user retweetsÂ\xa0tweets from two or more other users21. Two distinct communities emerged, a denier communityÂ\xa0and a believer community (Fig.Â\xa03A). The community of climate change believers (blue nodes) isÂ\xa0larger, with 1029 users andâ€‰~â€‰224,000 co-retweets, giving it a broader reach and influence on Twitter than the denier community (red nodes), which has 171 users andâ€‰~â€‰15,000 co-retweets. The proportion of deniers among the top 1200 influential users (14.3%) aligned with the national percentage of climate change deniers identified in our model (14.8%).\nInfluencers detected in climate change co-retweeted networks. (A) Co-retweeted networks formed by the 1200 most retweeted users in the U.S. The nodes represent unique accounts; the edges represent co-retweeted relationships. The size of nodes and the shade of the node color are proportional to their influence, as measured by eigenvector centrality scores. The high density of edges within the communities makes many individual edges not displayable. The top influencers in the community of climate change deniers (B) and believers (C) are labeled with the usernames. In panels (B) and (C), edges-to-users in the other community are not displayed.\nBoth believers and deniers mostly shared information and interacted within their own community. Users from the two communities were rarely co-retweeted, as illustrated by the distance between the cluster of nodes for each community and the low number of edges connecting the two communities. Amongâ€‰~â€‰230,000 co-retweets, only 4083 (<â€‰0.02%) were between users having opposite views on climate change. This low percentage of co-retweets of contrasting views highlights an echo-chamber effect. We found that a few nodes bridge the gap between the two communities, notably conservative news outlets such as Fox News and the Washington Examiner.\nTo identify the most influential users, we calculated the eigenvector centrality value per Twitter user. A high score means that a user was co-retweeted with many other users who also had high scores. Among climate change deniers, former U.S. President Donald Trump had the biggest influence (Fig.Â\xa03B). Three groups of influential deniers were heavily co-retweeted with President Trump: (i) conservative media outlets that regularly broadcast contrarian views on climate change, including alt-right news and blogs such as The Daily Wire, Daily Caller, Breitbart and thebradfordfile; (ii) mis/disinformation websites that publish misleading and false claims about climate change, including TownHall Media and the Climate Depot; andÂ\xa0(iii) right-wing producers, political commentators, and activists. Collectively, in concert with former President Trump and close colleagues, these three groups formed an organized and coordinated social media network, enabling climate change denialism to amplify and expand.\nIn contrast, the larger blue community is more diffuse. Politicians dominated the most influential users (Fig.Â\xa03C). Of the top 30 influential believers, 15 accounts belong to members of the Democratic Party, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris (Table S1). Eight of the top 30 nodes were popular media outlets, or websites, such as CNN, NBC, ABC, The Hill, The Washington Post, TheÂ\xa0New York Times. Other influential nodes included popular science communicators and entertainers advocating scientific consensus.\nHow does climate change-related tweeting and topic use vary over time?\nTo investigate the dynamics of tweeting activity for both communities and to understand how each perceived and responded to real-world events, we performed topic modeling and time series analysis of tweet volume. This analysis revealed how each group reacted selectively and opportunistically to the 17 events that occurred during the period of data collection (November 2017â€“May 2019).\nConsistent with the larger size of the believer community, this community had a consistent pattern of climate change tweet activity throughout the sampling period (Fig.Â\xa04A). In contrast, the denier community had lower activity overall. However, both communities had periods of high activity with spikes that exceeded the average pattern. The number of these high spikes was lower for the denier community. By manually identifying events that potentially triggered these large spikes, we found that deniers and believers do not always respond to the same events. Only six events triggered higher than average tweet volume by the denier community (Table S3): three were related to extreme cold weather events, two were related to United Nations activities about climate change â€”a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and an annual meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24), and the last was an attack on climate change deniers by Bill Nye in an HBO broadcast. Intriguingly, two of the highest spikes by the believer community occurred with events associated with President Trump that sparked high activity in the denier community, suggesting that these communities tried to influence or counter each other.\nEvents that drive tweet volume among deniers and believers and topic prevalence for typical events. (A) Original tweet volume per day and locally weighted regression lines are plotted over time for both climate change deniers and believers. Events that sparked online discussions are labeled alongside tweet volume spikes numerically and detailed inÂ\xa0the lower left. Red bubbles denote the events that a large group of deniers were actively involved with (>â€‰1000 original tweets). The gap in November 2018 and between January and April 2019 was due to discontinued data collection. (B) Topic prevalence for typical major events22: Events 3 and 6 represent extreme cold weather events; Event 5 represents top denier influencer Donald Trump tweeting about cold weather and doubts aboutÂ\xa0global warming; Event 12 represents the Trump AdministrationÂ\xa0publicly refuting theÂ\xa0validity of the IPCC 2018 report (https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009157940); and Event 13, a UN climate change conference (COP24), represents an event that engaged both deniers and believers.\nTo gain further insight into whether the groups attempted to counter each other, we classified tweets of believers and deniers for these 17 events based on the five climate change narratives (seeÂ\xa0Fig.Â\xa04B) proposed by Cook22. Overall, the major narrative in the believer community was â€œThere is still time to adapt,""Â\xa0representing 42% of the total tweets). In contrast, deniers focused tweeting activity on the message â€œClimate change is not real,â€ as indicated by 48% of the tweets falling into this category.\nAlthough weather events were associated with spikes in tweets from both communities, events viewed as abnormal weather caused by climate change [the California Wildfires (Event 9) and Hurricane Florence (Event 10) triggered a high volume of tweets among believers and events viewed as colder-than-expected weather [a snowstorm in Texas (Event 3) and a blizzard in the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions (Event 6) triggered a surge in tweets amongst deniers. Both colder-than-expected weather events provided an opportunity for the deniers to espouse that climate change is not real (64% of theÂ\xa0total tweets for both events), to delegitimize scientific consensus (12% ofÂ\xa0the total) and to reaffirm the claim that the changing climate is a normal geologic process andÂ\xa0to foment doubt that human activities are a source of this change (13% ofÂ\xa0the total).\nConsistent with an attempt to counter each otherâ€™s messages, the December 2017 tweet by Trump casting doubt on global warming due to a blizzard (Event 5) triggered the believer community to issue tweets emphasizing that climate change is unequivocal (32% of theÂ\xa0total) and that there is clear scientific consensus (35% ofÂ\xa0the total). A common refrain among deniers was that climate change is a conspiracy theory or hoax (59% ofÂ\xa0the total) and a shadowy attempt to dupe the public into bearing the costs of decarbonization, while generating enormous wealth for Blue â€˜elitesâ€™ (9% ofÂ\xa0the total). These tweets were heavily re-tweeted by conservative media (e.g., Daily Caller), right-wing activists (e.g., Chuck Woolery), and mis/disinformation sites (e.g., Watts Up With That?) (Table S1).\nConflicting messages were also common in response to COP24, consistent with an attempt to influence opinion. Believers overwhelmingly advocated for timely collective action or promoted campaigns showcasing impacts of and solutions to climate change (50% of the total). Deniers focused on conspiracy theories (climate change is not real, 46%) or a Democratic party agenda filled withÂ\xa0impractical solutions (26%).\nStudy limitations\nOur modeling approach has several limitations. First, X (formerly Twitter) has limited the number of posts a user can read in a day, ostensibly to prevent â€˜data scrapingâ€™ practices from unauthorized users. If this policy persists, then it will hamper research that relies on social media data to assess online beliefs and sentiment. This has implications in terms of the replicability of our modeling to other countries, time frames, and topics23,24,25. A second limitation of our modeling is that uncertainty is higher in areas with low population densities (e.g., rural areas) due to small sample sizes26. This is a well-known limitation of using social media to assess consensus and is even more pronounced in countries where use of social media is limited. To minimize this effectÂ\xa0in our study, we normalized input data by county population and employed a weighted approach using the total count of tweets as weights both for the calculation of bivariate relationships and for the regression models (see â€œMethodsâ€). Third, our classification scheme labeled tweets as either believing or denying climate change. National surveys indicate a percentage of the population (5â€“15%) who remain neutral or may not have a particular opinion on the topic27. In our binary classification, we used those climate change-related keywords that indicated a clear position (for or against) on the issue. As a portion of our sample uses sarcastic or ambivalent language that is difficult for the model to distinguish, classifying these tweets can be challenging. To address this, we calculated confidence for each prediction (see â€œMethodsâ€) to filter out those with low confidence (CIâ€‰<â€‰0.75).\nDiscussion\nUsing data from Twitter (now X), we used AI techniques and network analysis toÂ\xa0delineate a comprehensive socialÂ\xa0anatomy of climate change denialism in the U.S., at the state and county levels. We identified geographic clusters of climate change denial in Republican counties, especially rural ones, and among residents who do not have a college education. This provides critical knowledge for identifying segments of the population that would benefit from targeted efforts to expand awareness of the risks associated with climate changeÂ\xa0and strategies to increase local resilience.\nThe strong correlation between denialism and low COVID-19 vaccination rates indicated a broad skepticism of science generally amongst climate change deniers, which corresponds to resistance to science-based public policies such as shelter-in-place COVID-19 mandates28 or mask usage29. This finding indicates that communities with aÂ\xa0high prevalence of deniers are at risk for discounting other science-based health or safety recommendations. According to the theory of identity-protective cognition, people tend to selectively credit or discredit evidence in patterns that reflect beliefs that predominate in their group30,31. This theory helps explain why those who vote Republican are more likely to believe tweets from former President Trump regarding climate change than from other sources; it is identity affirming.\nClassifying tweets based on the Cookâ€™s five categories22 enables identification of commonly deployed rhetorical strategies to promote climate misinformation, and in science denialism more broadly32. In our 7.3 million tweet sample, these techniques included fake experts, who have possessed little to no expertise about the underlying science but nonetheless conveyed messages that cast doubt. They serve as a credible messenger in which someone shares the same moral values and uses language consistent with existing beliefs12,33. One such example is the tweet by the Trump Administration casting doubts on the IPCC 2018 Climate Report, which was retweeted heavily by supporters. Then there are logical fallacies, such as a tweet by Trump questioning global warming because of an unusual cold weather event that went viral34. Other common strategies include impossible expectations as well as cherry picking to attack climate change science and scientists.\nCombating misinformation requires effective refutation strategies35. Deploying such strategies onÂ\xa0social media sites such as X, however, is challenging as denier and believer communities are isolated from each other, leading to echo chambers19. Only 0.02% of the co-retweets about climate change were between users having opposing views. Consequently, this leads one to conclude that believers have limited ability to reach deniers through the social media platform. One strategy is to label denialism tweets as misinformation. However, some evidence suggests that this can strengthen opposition rather than change attitudes36. Another option is to flag accounts that disseminate misinformation or dangerous information. For example, then-Twitter banned Donald Trump (his account has since been restored) from using the site because of tweets maintaining election fraud and supporting the January 6 capital riots37. Twitter also banned accounts for spreading COVID-19 misinformation and calling for violence against media38. As with COVID-19, climate change is a humanitarian crisis that will affect millions, albeit at a more elongated temporal scale. Based on current policy, X (formerly Twitter) does not appear to be imposing account bans or suspensions for promoting climate change denialism. This, and related policy changes associated with new ownership of the social media platform, may make it even more susceptible to the spread of misinformation.\nCommunities face increasing risks related to climate change, such as flooding, wildfire, heat stress, and sea-level rise. The scientific community has already identified especially vulnerable communities and regions39. Climate change denialism is also a risk, in the form of knowledge vulnerability. Those who discount climate change as a natural rather than human-induced process tend to underestimate their current (and future) risk to it. This renders them less likely to take necessary steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\nMethods\nOpinion data\nAs primary data, we used an open access dataset created by George Washington University that is available from the GWU Libraries Dataverse40. This dataset was created using the Twitter Stream API and containsâ€‰~â€‰40 million tweets related to climate change and global warming. It covers a two-year period from September 2017 to May 2019. We initially retrievedâ€‰~â€‰27.3 million raw tweets based on tweet IDs. Theâ€‰~â€‰30% loss of tweets was due to deleted or inactive accounts since 2019.\nTo extract tweets located in the U.S., we developed a rule based on the geo-attributes in the raw data. We extracted the self-reported location information in an account profile. A large proportion of users (>â€‰73%) provided the location information in our dataset. To standardize the addresses and improve the geocoding process, we first transformed all the user locations to lower case and removed the URL links, emojis, punctuation marks, and other non-ASCII characters. Next, we extracted all the unique user locations (~â€‰640,000 â€œcleanâ€ addresses) and standardized all the U.S. state and city abbreviations. As a final step, we manually inspected and removed national level and obviously fake user locations.\nAfter the preprocessing, we used the Nominatim API server to geocode user locations based on the OpenStreetMap database41. We removed locations outside the U.S., and classified addresses within the U.S. into two levels: (1) county level with tweets from users reporting their local address, city, or county; (2) state level with tweets from users reporting only the state. In the state-level tweets, we also added the aggregated county-level tweets. We then rejoined these unique U.S. addresses and the corresponding geographical coordinates to the original datasets by spatial level. The geocoding yieldedâ€‰~â€‰1.3 million unique users andâ€‰~â€‰5.2 million county-level tweets andâ€‰~â€‰7.4 million state-level tweets, from whichâ€‰~â€‰2.2 million tweets had state-level only information. To reduce the incidence of non-human accounts in our sampleÂ\xa0(i.e. tweet bots), we removed users who tweeted more than 20 times a day. Figures S1 and S2 presents the data spatial distribution and representativeness analysis.\nTweet classification\nTo identify climate change opinions on Twitter, we built a tweet classifier based on the Transformer, a deep learning model in the field of natural language processing42. We parameterized the model to classify tweets as either believing in the existence of climate change (predicted as â€˜forâ€™) or denying that climate change is real (predicted as â€˜againstâ€™). Instead of training a model de novo, the Transformer uses language models pre-trained on large text corpora in an unsupervised manner and then uses user-labeled training samples to fine-tune the model for specific natural language tasks. Our classifier was built upon OpenAI GPT-2, a large transformer-based language model pre-trained on a database ofâ€‰~â€‰8 million web pages43. Previous studies found that the GPT-2 model performs well in classifying short text from social media44.\nWe built a training dataset of manually labeled tweets to fine tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model. Labeled samples were randomly extracted only from the 1.4 million original tweets, excluding retweets and quotes. Each tweet was reviewed independently by two members of the research team and labeled as either â€˜againstâ€™ or â€˜forâ€™ climate change. In rare occasions where a tweetâ€™s message was ambiguous and there was disagreement between the two members of the research team, the tweet was excluded from the model\'s training data due to its potential to introduce noise to the model.\nWe labeled training tweets as â€˜forâ€™ or â€˜againstâ€™ climate change if they had one of the following viewpoints listed in Table 3. This labeling resulted in a balanced sample of 6,500 tweets (3300 â€˜forâ€™ tweets and 3200 â€˜againstâ€™ tweets) that we used as a training set for the model. Tweets with ambiguous messages, sarcastic language or tweets that were irrelevant to climate change were discarded from the training dataset.\nOur model was built upon the Huggingface Transformers45 Library and implemented in PyTorch46. To increase the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy, we fine-tuned the parameters that resulted in an optimum learning rate at 1eâˆ’5, with dropouts at 0.1. Tweets with sarcastic, ambiguous or irrelevant messages were evaluated with the model, but the predictions based on these tweets tended to be invalid or random. To overcome this limitation, we used the Softmax function embodied in PyTorch, which calculated the prediction confidence for every individual tweet. Based on this score, we removed predictions with low confidence (CIâ€‰<â€‰0.75). The final classification was performed on the complete set of 7.4 million tweets from the collection period. We then aggregated tweets at the county and state levels and calculated percentages of â€˜againstâ€™ tweets and â€˜forâ€™ tweets as proxies of deniers and believers.\nTo evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, we performed a series of validation tests. We manually labeled an independent validation dataset to test model accuracy. To ensure the validation dataset was balanced across the two categories and was spatially representative, we randomly extracted 30 unique original tweets from each state. Our fine-tuned model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.91 and F1 score of 0.90 (Fig. S3). Our model predictions were compared with national estimates of climate change opinion based on representative surveys, showing that our model provided a percentage for U.S. climate change deniers within the range of those determined from the surveys (Fig. S4). To validate our results at the sub-national level, we used the Yale Climate Opinion Surveys. The Yale Surveys use a downscaling statistical model based on national survey data and are the only surveys that provide climate change opinion estimates at the state and county levels. We compared these data with our model results at both state and county levels by calculatingÂ\xa0the Pearson correlationÂ\xa0coefficient. To normalize the data, we weighted the variables per population of each state and county (US Census 2018).\nCorrelation analysis\nTo examine what drives climate change opinion, we performed a series of correlation analyses. Studies have shown that climate change opinion is strongly correlated with political affiliation which is considered a major driver47,48. In addition to political ideology, studies have shown evidence that the socio-demographic profile also plays a role in climate change opinion as does the local microclimate49,50, and personal experience with extreme weather events, although the evidence is mixed and at times amb","{'tone': 'Argumentative', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'summary': 'The main point being made in these comments is that there is a divide between those who acknowledge the scientific evidence for climate change and those who deny it, often due to political affiliations or misinformation from certain media sources. The comments highlight the need for greater public understanding and acceptance of climate science.'}","['This is a well-reasoned and well-researched study that sheds important light on the concerning phenomenon of climate change denial in the United States. The findings clearly demonstrate that climate change denial is not evenly distributed, but rather clusters in certain regions and sociodemographic groups, particularly among Republicans, the less educated, and those living in carbon-intensive economies. \n\nThe analysis of social media networks reveals how a coordinated network of influencers, including politicians, media outlets, and activists, actively work to sow doubt and misinformation about climate science. This is deeply troubling, as it renders vulnerable communities unprepared to take necessary steps to build resilience. \n\nAs the authors note, combating such widespread climate denialism requires multi-pronged strategies, including targeted educational campaigns and increased accountability for social media platforms that allow the proliferation of climate misinformation. This study provides a crucial evidence base to guide such critical interventions. Overall, this is a vital contribution to our understanding of the social dynamics underlying climate change denial in the U.S.']"

    Even though you're replying to the other comments, your reply must contain content from this article - Greta Thunberg: Who is the climate activist and what has she achieved?
Greta Thunberg is one of the world's best-known climate change campaigners.
She has been credited with raising public awareness, especially amongst young people
Who is Greta Thunberg and how did she become a climate activist?
Ms Thunberg was born in the Swedish capital Stockholm in 2003. Her mother Malena Ernman is an opera singer, and her father Svante Thunberg is an actor. 
She first learned about climate change when she was eight. 
When she was 11 or 12, she started suffering from depression, according to her father, Svante. 
""She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,"" he said. 
Around the same time she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. 
In summer 2018, aged 15, Ms Thunberg held the first ""School Strike for Climate"" outside the Swedish parliament. 
The protest was widely covered, and hundreds of thousands of young people across the world joined her Fridays For Future strikes.
Mr Thunberg says his daughter became ""much happier"" after she started campaigning. 
She has described her autism diagnosis as a ""superpower"" which helped motivate her protests. 
""Being different is a gift,"" she told the BBC. ""If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike.""
Between 2019 and 2020, she took a year out of school to concentrate on activism, and became famous for her impassioned speeches to world leaders.
She left school in summer 2023, and ended her school climate strikes. 
Ms Thunberg has been arrested several times for her participation in environmental protests around the world and fined by the Swedish courts. 
What have been her most famous speeches?
In April 2019, aged 16, Ms Thunberg told members of the European Parliament: ""Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly, because at the moment they are not.""
Five months later, she sailed by yacht across the Atlantic to address a UN climate action summit in New York.
""I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,"" she told delegates. ""Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.""
Speaking at a youth protest in Glasgow in 2021, after the city hosted the COP26 climate change summit, she said: ""[World leaders have held] 26 COPs. They have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?""
What awards has Greta Thunberg won?
Ms Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023.
In 2019, she became the youngest-ever Time Person of the Year. 
Also in 2019, she won the Right Livelihood Award (known as the Alternative Nobel Prize) and Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award, and was listed by Forbes as one of the world's 100 most powerful women.
In 2022, she brought out The Climate Book, which contains essays from 100 scientists, writers and activists about how to combat the climate crisis.
What have Greta Thunberg's critics said about her?
At the start of 2023, controversial media personality Andrew Tate baited Ms Thunberg on X, formerly Twitter, by listing his 33 cars and offering to send her details of their ""enormous emissions"". 
She responded with a sarcastic tweet which was liked by several million people and shared widely. 
She was also mocked on Twitter by former US President Donald Trump when she won the Time magazine award. He said: ""Greta must work on her Anger Management problem... Chill Greta, Chill!"". 
Russian President Vladimir Putin described her as a ""kind, but poorly informed, teenager"".
What has Greta Thunberg's campaigning achieved?
Although Ms Thunberg has not devised any specific environmental strategies, she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people.
Many commentators call this ""the Greta effect"". 
Broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough told her: ""You have aroused the world. I'm very grateful to you.""

Three Steps to Choosing Keywords
Three Steps to Choosing Keywords Example
Still Struggling?
Conversing with someone else about your research and writing process can be incredibly helpful.  Contact staff at McKillop Library or the Writing Center using the links below.
Definition
Keywords are the main words or phrases you will use to search for sources on your topic.  You can generally identify your first keywords by selecting the major terms from your research question.  You will use these terms as you search the library catalog, databases, and the web.  By creating a list of keywords, you'll be able to construct better and more efficient searches. 
For example, take the research question ""Why has the acceptance of body art increased in American society over time?""  The keywords for this question are in bold in the text below:
Why has the acceptance of body art increased in American society over time?
Keywords: body art, American society
Three Steps to Choosing Keywords
1. Extract single keywords or short phrases.
As seen in our example above, you want to leave out articles (""a,"" ""an,"" and ""the""), prepositions or verb phrases (like ""on,"" ""in,"" ""going to""), verbs (action words), and both adverbs and adjectives (descriptive words) when selecting keywords.  Instead, focus on the nouns in your sentence.
It's important to note that you do not want to use complete sentences when you start searching for sources.  Catalogs and databases struggle to identify relevant terms from full sentences, which is why you have to isolate those words in advance.
2. Experiment with synonyms.
Try to think of other words that have the same meaning as your keywords.  For example, if you started with the phrase ""global warming,"" you might also want to try searching for ""climate change.""  An online or print thesaurus can help identify useful synonyms.
3. Brainstorm related terms or subtopics.
It helps to think of other words and phrases that relate to your topic.  This can be especially helpful if you are having trouble identifying good keywords or if you need to refine your research focus.  For example, if your initial topic was global warming, you might want to consider searching ""acid rain,"" ""air pollution,"" or ""biodiversity.""  Related terms are often more specific or less specific than your initial search terms.  Each combination will change the number, type, and relevance of your search results.
Three Steps to Choosing Keywords Example
1. Extract single keywords or short phrases.
Let's work with the keywords identified at the top of this page: body art, American society
2. Experiment with synonyms.
American society: America, United States
3. Brainstorm related terms or subtopics.
Body art: tattoo(s), tattoo parlor, tattoo artist(s), body piercing, piercing(s), performance art
American society: American men, American women, millennials
Note: The concept of time is important in the provided research question.  While no specific time period is provided, it might be useful to try adding search terms like ""nineteenth century,"" ""twentieth century,"" and ""twenty-first century.""  Searching for time periods is tricky, but it does sometimes yield useful results, particularly if you're trying to show how something has changed over time.
Annotated Bibliographies
An annotated bibliography constitutes a list of sources that you have identified for your research paper and includes a brief summary and analysis of each source. The goal is to briefly summarize the source, generally in 50 to 150 words, and explain why it is important for a topic. Annotations are a single concise paragraph, but might be longer if you are summarizing and evaluating.
The style of annotations can vary from simply summarizing sources, or taking it a step further, and provide an evaluation of sources. For an evaluative annotation, start by analyzing how the source changes your topic: what does it add to your understanding of the topic and the debate on the topic? What new questions does it bring up? Also, relate each source to your research question. Ask yourself how your research question may change because of the source.  Below, you'll find instructions on writing evaluative annotations. 
The components of an evaluative annotation
1. Citation: Cite the book, article, or document using the appropriate style. 
2. Summary: 1-2 sentence overview of the main arguments in the article or book
3. Annotation: Assess & reflect 
What to include when assessing and evaluating
Purpose - Why are they writing the article or doing the research? 
Author - Who is the author? What is their occupation/position, education, experience? Is the author qualified? 
Author Bias - Does the author make assumptions upon which the rationale of the article or research rests? What are they?

The clean energy claims of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell: A mismatch between discourse, actions and investments
Figures
Abstract
The energy products of oil and gas majors have contributed significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and planetary warming over the past century. Decarbonizing the global economy by mid-century to avoid dangerous climate change thus cannot occur without a profound transformation of their fossil fuel-based business models. Recently, several majors are increasingly discussing clean energy and climate change, pledging decarbonization strategies, and investing in alternative energies. Some even claim to be transforming into clean energy companies. Given a history of obstructive climate actions and “greenwashing”, there is a need to objectively evaluate current and historical decarbonization efforts and investment behavior. This study focuses on two American (Chevron, ExxonMobil) and two European majors (BP, Shell). Using data collected over 2009–2020, we comparatively examine the extent of decarbonization and clean energy transition activity from three perspectives: (1) keyword use in annual reports (discourse); (2) business strategies (pledges and actions); and (3) production, expenditures and earnings for fossil fuels along with investments in clean energy (investments). We found a strong increase in discourse related to “climate”, “low-carbon” and “transition”, especially by BP and Shell. Similarly, we observed increasing tendencies toward strategies related to decarbonization and clean energy. But these are dominated by pledges rather than concrete actions. Moreover, the financial analysis reveals a continuing business model dependence on fossil fuels along with insignificant and opaque spending on clean energy. We thus conclude that the transition to clean energy business models is not occurring, since the magnitude of investments and actions does not match discourse. Until actions and investment behavior are brought into alignment with discourse, accusations of greenwashing appear well-founded.

1. Introduction
Efforts to limit planetary warming to below 2°C or 1.5°C entail a transition to net-zero-emissions energy systems by 2050 [1]. This carries vast implications for fossil fuel producers. Twenty fossil fuel companies are responsible for 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane emissions worldwide since 1965 [2, 3]. The leading investor-owned emitter is Chevron, followed closely by Exxon, BP, and Shell. The products of these four energy giants account for more than 10% of global carbon emissions since 1965 [2, 3].
As the world shifts away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change and air pollution, oil majors’ historically prosperous business models must grapple with the likelihood of decreased demand for hydrocarbons and fewer opportunities for profit [4], especially since the pandemic situation [5]. Symbolically illustrating this, in 2020, ExxonMobil dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index after nearly a century [6]. Meanwhile, electric-vehicle maker Tesla’s market value reached US $800 billion, propelling CEO Elon Musk to the status of the world’s richest man [7]. BP even suggested that oil demand may already have peaked [8]. Multiple developments are driving this shift. These include the electrification of road transport and government policies aiming to phase out internal combustion engines [9], divestment targeting the fossil fuel industry [10], climate policies targeting fossil fuel extraction and usage [11, 12] as well as government-led lawsuits and inquiries (including the U.S. Congress) against oil companies for delaying climate action and disseminating misinformation [13–17]. To survive in this changing market, oil majors face an urgent need to transition to a carbon-free business model [18, 19]. Indeed, some suggest that to meet the Paris Agreement goals, no additional CO2-emitting fossil fuel infrastructure should be commissioned, and early retirement of existing projects is required [1].
Oil majors have made both proactive and regressive steps toward this. Recently, some have begun investing in renewables and low-carbon technology [18, 20]. Many have announced various targets to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations or products [21] while stating public support for carbon pricing [22, 23]. Some—such as BP and Repsol—even claim to be transitioning to clean energy [3].
However, historical behavior suggests that the authenticity of such claims should be examined critically and exhaustively. Multiple studies document how oil majors have strategically spread misinformation and aggressively obstructed progress toward climate action. ExxonMobil is a flagrant example, having strategically denied climate change and propagated disinformation to mislead the public for over 20 years [24–26]. Multiple majors have tried to shift the responsibility for climate change onto consumers (BP’s promotion of reducing individual carbon footprints is one example) [25, 27, 28]. The biggest American and European majors have also spent millions lobbying to delay or weaken climate policy [3, 15, 29]. Recently, oil majors are observed to be using advertising on social media platforms to influence public opinion and promote an image of green fossil fuels [30]. Research [3, 31] finds that even the most ambitious majors are simply mitigating future carbon risks by diversifying energy products rather than pursuing company-wide decarbonization. Given this track record, decarbonization claims by oil majors have been critiqued as “greenwashing” [32–34]. This is where corporate strategies—especially discourse and pledges to stakeholders—depict proactive actions that exceed a company’s actual environmental performance [35, 36].
This situation points to a strong need to comprehensively investigate the actual state of actions by oil majors to decarbonize and transition to clean energy. Previous scholarship has tackled this from diverse but disparate perspectives. This includes societal accountability [22, 23], the spreading of climate disinformation [24], lobbying [29, 37], emissions reductions efforts for operations and downstream products [38, 39] and renewables investment [21, 40]. Some recent studies focus on broader efforts to transition business models and phase out fossil fuel production [41].
This literature has limitations. Typically focusing on a single year [21, 22, 38, 42], prevalent approaches cannot fully identify the evolving nature of decarbonization trajectories. A long-term perspective is critical, since fossil fuel majors differ from smaller entities, whose transition strategies might proceed faster. Additionally, most research focuses on public statements or a narrow range of business strategies [22]. This hampers the ability to comprehensively monitor the complex and intertwined strategies making up a clean energy transition. Relying only on public statements alone also risks overestimating a company’s performance due to greenwashing tactics. Thus, objectively examining the extent of transition strategies by oil majors requires a multi-year approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data.
This study, therefore, assesses the extent to which oil majors are divesting from fossil fuels and transitioning toward clean energy. Focusing on four—ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and Chevron—we examine behavior from three perspectives: (1) discourse: frequency of climate- and clean-energy-related keyword use in annual reports; (2) strategies: pledges and actions related to decarbonization and clean energy and (3) investments: production, expenditures and earnings for fossil fuels as well as investments in clean energy. The analysis covers over a decade of activity (2009–2020), using publicly available qualitative and quantitative data.
Our scholarly contribution is two-fold. Empirically, we reveal the actual extent to which each major is moving toward a clean-energy-based business model. Theoretically, our analytical framework can be used or built on by scholars to measure the transition behavior of other fossil fuel-centric industries.
2. Methods
2.1 Sample selection
Four oil majors were selected for analysis: two from the US (Chevron, ExxonMobil) and two from Europe (BP, Shell). Together with Total, ConocoPhillips, and Eni, they comprise a larger group of seven international oil companies listed on the American and European stock markets [4]. We selected these four for two reasons. First, based on product-based GHG emissions since 1965, this group represents the top-ranking emitters among all investor-owned energy majors. Second, the balance of two American and two European majors allows analysis of contrasting attitudes and responses to the energy transition. Specifically, prior research [31, 41–43] has shown the American majors as resistant or obstructive, and the European companies as slightly more proactive.
2.2 Study design and methods
The aim of this study is to assess the extent to which the above four oil majors are transitioning from a business model based primarily on fossil fuels towards one based on clean energy. In line with literature [44, 45], we expect this transition to involve a continual and multi-year process whereby oil and gas businesses are gradually contracted while investments in renewables are expanded, eventually replacing fossil fuel extraction and sales. We also expect the ultimate goal of such a transition to be net-zero; to eliminate all GHG emissions that result from the production or use of energy products [4, 46]. To measure and compare each major’s transition activities, in accord with our triple analysis of discourse, strategies and investments, our study design consists of the following three steps and sets of assumptions. Data for all steps covers the 12-year study period 2009–2020.
The first step examines the frequency of 39 keywords in annual reports published during the study period (Table 1). Following literature [47], we counted the frequency of each term and variants, dividing by the total word count in each report to normalize results. Terms were identified first from oil-industry grey literature [4, 48, 49] then organized into four categories: (i) climate change, focused on detecting awareness of climate-related concepts; (ii) transition, examining discourse reflecting a resolve to transition business models; (iii) emissions, showing acknowledgment of the need to reduce various GHG emissions; and (iv) clean energy, reflecting statements related to investments in non-fossil fuel or decarbonized energies. These categories capture the cognition of four key perspectives deemed essential to the clean-energy transformation of the oil industry.


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263596.t001
In selecting this approach, we assume that the frequency by which keywords are used will provide a rough proxy for the degree of awareness and importance placed on these issues [50]. Not overlooking the possibility of greenwashing [51], we view discourse and attention to climate and clean-energy issues as a precursor to concrete actions like investments and organizational transformation [52]. We focus on annual reports because they are the most official and representative of the various documents written to shareholders and stakeholders, and because their consistent year-to-year format is well suited to comparisons.
S1 File details our procedure for selecting and omitting keywords. S1 Dataset contains all data collected and processed for this step.
Our second step identifies and compares the annual status of strategies reflecting a transition towards a clean-energy business model. We sourced 25 indicators from academic and grey literature (Table 2) and organized these into four categories. These capture the presence of pledges and disclosure (14 indicators; shown as “P&D”) as well as concrete actions (11 indicators; shown as “A”). When referring to indicators, we use codes. For example, “BM1-P&D” refers to indicator 1 (pledges and disclosure) of the business model category.


              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263596.t002
2.2.2.1 Climate-change cognition (CC). Providing the intellectual justification to take action, these indicators serve as preconditions or predictors for pursuing a transition to clean energy [22]. The first two measure the presence of official statements acknowledging the link between human activities and climate change (CC1-P&D) and the need to reduce either emissions from fossil fuel combustion or production volumes (CC2-P&D). Next, participation in industry coalitions for decarbonization has incited pro-climate behavior amongst oil majors [31]. We thus measure participation in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) (CC3-A) due to its status as the leading global framework for guiding the oil industry’s response to climate change [48, 53]. We also examine recognition of two risks related to climate change: regulatory and market (CC4-P&D, CC5-P&D).
2.2.2.2 Business model (BM). This category measures the presence of a concrete transition strategy (BM1-P&D and BM2-A), along with pledges and actions to reduce exploration or production of non-sequestered fossil fuels due to climate concerns (BM3-P&D to BM6-A) and to transition the workforce to clean-energy businesses (BM7-P&D and BM8-A). We measure support for government carbon-pricing policies (BM9-P&D) and the introduction of carbon costs into internal decision-making (BM10-A). These strategies are widely recognized as indicating a shift toward clean energy [54–59].
2.2.2.3 Emissions reduction (ER). This category measures the presence of pledges and actions to reduce GHG emissions. Since the concrete goal of achieving zero emissions by 2050 is shared globally [60, 61], we evaluate if each major pledges to reach net-zero on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner (ER1-P&D, ER2-A). Observing the growing importance of reducing the GHG emissions resulting from end-user combustion of energy products [4, 62, 63], we evaluate the presence of pledges and strategies to reduce scope 3 emissions intensity (ER3-P&D, ER4-A). We also search for multi-year ambitions and strategies to reduce methane emissions (ER5-P&D, ER6-A), and complete disclosure of all GHG emissions for scope 1, 2, and 3 (ER7-P&D).
In designing these indicators, we exclude targets to reduce GHG emissions and actual emissions performance each year. This reflects the view that relative emissions per unit of output are naturally decreasing due to technical improvements in operation [3,43], and that absolute emissions each year are principally determined by hydrocarbon production volumes. Thus, focusing on these annually declining emissions metrics would not reveal behavior consistent with a transition to clean energy.
2.2.2.4 Clean energy investment (CE). This category emphasizes investments in renewables—the core driver of transition [64]. We measure whether each major transparently discloses the annual volume of investments made in clean energy (CE1-A), and whether this is above 1% of total CAPEX (CE2-P&D, CE3-A). This highly conservative 1% threshold follows observations that investment volumes by oil majors, being still outside their core business areas, have been consistently less than this amount [4].
Data to apply this framework was sourced from annual reports, sustainability reports, and energy-transition reports published by each major during the study period. Based on quantitative or collective evidence, we evaluated each major’s actions using numerical scoring:
We provide concrete examples of scoring decisions for all indicators in (S2 File).
Additionally, all data collected and examined for this step is available in (S2–S5 Datasets).
The third step analyzes financial-performance data collected from each major’s annual reports over the study period. This tracks changes in annual financial activity in six areas: (i) CAPEX for upstream businesses related to fossil fuels (i.e. oil and gas), which includes exploration, field development and production, midstream transportation, storage and processing, and the marketing and trading of oil and natural gas, (ii) associated earnings, (iii) fossil fuel production volumes, (iv) fossil fuel reserve estimates, (v) downstream sales, and (xi) CAPEX in clean-energy production and technologies. In processing data, we mainly use ratios instead of absolute volumes. Relative amounts (i.e. ratios) are better suited to showing the structure of each major’s earnings and production portfolio, since absolute volumes (e.g. CAPEX, fossil fuels sales) vary significantly each year with changing market situations (e.g. oil prices).
First, analysis of CAPEX volumes shows each major’s annual spending—through acquisition, upgrading, and maintenance—on fixed assets supporting the upstream production of oil and gas (original data is reported as millions of dollars). We calculate the percentage of fossil fuel-related CAPEX relative to total CAPEX, which also includes downstream and other capital outlays. Collection of this data is based on expectations that a major undergoing transition would reduce CAPEX volumes for upstream fossil fuel production, channeling investments toward clean-energy businesses [71].
Second, analysis of total annual fossil fuel earnings reveals the business model’s dependence on fossil fuels. We report absolute earnings in millions of dollars first, then convert each to a relative share of total earnings. Again, we assume that both absolute and relative volumes of upstream earnings from fossil fuels would decline during a clean-energy transition. We expect this to occur as each major achieves a greater relative share of earnings from clean energy instead of fossil fuels [72]. Conversely, we expect that a higher dependence on fossil fuels for total earnings would reduce the economic rationale to transition [73, 74].
Third, analysis of average daily production volumes for oil (i.e. liquids) and gas is firstly shown as units of one thousand barrels per day for liquids, and millions of cubic feet per day for gas. In addition to showing combined annual production of oil and gas, we convert each to an incremental percentage, setting 2009 as the baseline. This allows us to minimize the influence of fossil fuel price fluctuation, since we focus on production volumes instead of sale revenues. Underpinning this analysis is the logic that curbing the supply of fossil fuels is crucial for meeting the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement [66, 75]; and that majors might choose to increase gas production due to its lower carbon intensity than oil [76].
Fourth, analysis of each major’s annual estimates of oil and gas reserves is based on original data reported as millions of barrels for liquids, and billions of cubic feet for gas. We again change to an incremental percentage, setting 2009 volumes as the baseline. In including this dimension, we expect those majors with greater fossil fuel reserves to experience the largest difficulties with leaving these assets in the ground, because of their financial value to share prices and future production [77–79].
Fifth, analysis of annual downstream petroleum sales is based on original data reported as one thousand barrels per day for refined oil, and one thousand tons per day for chemicals. We focus again on sales volumes of refined oil and chemicals, converting data to an incremental ratio, setting 2009 as the baseline. Here we assume that the reduced sale of processed hydrocarbon products, being a principal source of scope 3 emissions alongside unrefined oil and gas, would be another important goal for transitioning to a clean-energy-based business model [80].
Sixth, we compare two types of data for renewable energy investments: (i) expenditures in renewables production and technology development, shown as a share of total CAPEX; and (ii) renewable electricity generation capacity, shown as megawatts (MW). Data is not fully disclosed in annual reports, obliging us to use third-party sources, whose data shows only cumulative rather than annual trends. Specifically, CAPEX data sourced from CDP (2019) and Fletcher et al. (2018) [67, 81] shows only cumulative investments from 2010 to the third quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, data on renewable-electricity capacity, sourced from the Standard & Poor’s Global Platts website and database [82], shows only total amounts from 2009–2019.
All data collected and processed for this step is available in (S6 Dataset).
3. Findings
3.1 Discourse
Fig 1 shows the normalized results of the discourse analysis: the frequency of 39 keywords in annual reports. All majors show a clear increasing trend over the study period, most notably the European majors, particularly in the “transition” and “emissions” categories. Findings reflect an amplification of discourse about mitigating GHG emissions and increasing clean energy businesses.
Note: Results for ExxonMobil are affected by the style of reports examined (all years except 2020 are summary reports).

Shell is the only company showing a marked increase in all four categories over the study period, displaying a clean “J” curve. Notable keywords include “low-carbon energy” (increasing almost ten-fold, from 59 to 503 mentions), “renewable” (3 to 91), and “clean” (9 to 82). This shift in oral discourse is also visible in the evolving messages from Shell’s chairpersons. For example, in 2009, Jorma Ollila stated ambitions to produce more oil and natural gas to meet global energy demands [83, 84]. This was flipped in 2020, as Chad Holliday pledged a reoriented mission, to “play an essential role in the move to a cleaner, lower-carbon world” [83].
BP also shows a marked increase in keyword usage over the study period, especially in 2019. In contrast to Shell’s steadily rising trend, BP’s follows a “U” curve, with low points between 2012 and 2017. BP has increased usage of words in the “climate change” category in particular, from 22 to 326 mentions over 2009–2020. The “transition” category also increased markedly in the study period, from 50 to 418, reflecting increased discussion of a low-carbon business model. In 2009 the CEO considered BP an “oil company”, whereas in 2021, BP advocated transforming into an “integrated energy company” and pledged a transition to net-zero emissions [84].
Chevron is the only major not showing a noticeable increase. It trails the European majors in all categories, particularly “climate” and “transition”. The word “climate” was mentioned only 45 times for the entire study period and was missing from annual reports in 2009–2011. This compares to 171 mentions by BP in 2020 alone. Chevron’s lagging performance is also indicated by mention of “renewables”. This appears only in the glossary of terms of the 2009 annual report, and climbs to just 19 mentions in 2019 [85], compared to 92 times by BP.
Interpreting ExxonMobil’s results requires caution. This major increased its usage of keywords after 2014. But this is likely influenced by the style of annual reports. While the other three majors release full reports each year, ExxonMobil published only summaries (except 2020). Considering that total normalized keyword usage dips markedly in 2020 (when a full report was available), for other years, results appear to be inflated by the brevity of annual-report summaries. This aside, ExxonMobil’s results show an increase in discourse on “emissions” and “low carbon” energy. But the low frequency of keyword mentions in the “climate change” and “transition” categories reflects low attention to these issues. This differs from the European majors, where results in the “transition” category increase markedly. Furthermore, ExxonMobil’s use of several keywords is erratic. For example, in the “emissions” category, although “CO2” was mentioned 10 times in 2009 and 11 times in 2020, it was not found between 2011 and 2013.
3.2 Strategies: Pledges and actions
This section applies the framework explained in Section 2.2.3 and Table 2 to evaluate the state of pledges and concrete business actions that indicate a shift to clean energy. Results for each major appear in Fig 2A and 2B. The differing trajectories of pledges and actions appear in Fig 3. Detailed supporting evidence is provided in (S2–S5 Datasets). When discussing findings, we refer to indicators with codes explained in the Methods (Section 2.2.2).

Note on scores: “+1” indicates pledges and actions that implement or reinforce a strategy or commitment in that year; “-1” indicates pledges and actions that contradict or hamper a strategy or commitment in that year; and “0” indicates that no evidence of pledges and actions in either direction was found.

While the two European majors consistently acknowledge the anthropogenic causes of climate change (CC1-P&D) over the study period, the American majors have frequently ignored this topic. Only in 2018 did ExxonMobil recognize, indirectly and weakly, the link between fossil fuels and climate change in its annual report—and this position did not carry over into the 2020 version. Meanwhile, from 2011 to 2017, Chevron conceded in its corporate responsibility report that “use of fossil fuels to meet the world’s energy needs contributes to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere” [86]. Yet this acknowledgment vanished from later versions.
In contrast, the European majors have consistently acknowledged the link between fossil fuels and climate change. For Shell, this began in 2010 and evolved into stronger annual-report statements from 2015 on, such as: “We have long recognized that the use of fossil fuels contributes to climate change” [87]. BP follows a similar trend: its acknowledgment of climate change begins weakly in sustainability reports from 2010 [88], and evolves into stronger statements from 2012 on, such as: “action is needed to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases being emitted through fossil fuel use” [89].
For both the American and European majors, we find scant acknowledgment of the need to shift away from or reduce dependence on all types of non-sequestered fossil fuels (CC2-P&D). Overall, statements consistently argue the reverse. For example, from 2014, ExxonMobil began to reject the need to reduce emissions from hydrocarbon development [90], even strengthening this position in 2020: “With respect to energy supply, production reductions by individual companies would have no impact on demand or consumption of energy, and would simply result in production shifting from one producer to another” [91]. Chevron expresses similar views, stating as recently as 2019 that “a decrease in overall fossil fuel emissions is not inconsistent with continued or increased fossil fuel production by the most efficient producers” [92]. The European majors show a similar pattern of rejecting the need to transition away from non-sequestered fossil fuels. BP communicated in its annual report 2019 that producing more gas was consistent with a net-zero future [8]. This only changed in 2020, when BP announced the intention to reduce all fossil fuel production as part of its energy transition [84].
As the only indicator for action in this category, participation in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (CC3-A), established in 2014, indicates more rapid acknowledgment by the European majors of the need to begin the energy transition. Specifically, BP and Shell joined in 2015, three years before ExxonMobil and Chevron.
Finally, BP, Shell, and Chevron have actively disclosed climate-related regulatory risk since 2009 (CC4-P&D). Shell was the first to consistently acknowledge both regulatory and market risks from climate change in its annual reports. For the other three, disclosure of market risk (CC5-P&D) has probably lagged due to views that renewables would not pose a significant threat to hydrocarbon businesses in the short term [90, 93].
For the business model category, support for government carbon-pricing policies (BM9-P&D) and adoption of an internal carbon price for decision-making purposes (BM10-A) are the only areas where consistent activity is observed over the study period. BP and Shell have introduced carbon pricing into decision-making, each setting $40 per ton [88, 94]. Though ExxonMobil’s support for carbon policies dates back to at least 2009 [95], continuous consideration of carbon pricing in internal business decisions (BM10-A) did not occur until 2017.

Decarbonizing the global economy by mid-century to avoid dangerous climate change thus cannot occur without a profound transformation of their fossil fuel-based business models. Recently, several majors are increasingly discussing clean energy and climate change, pledging decarbonization strategies, and investing in alternative energies. Some even claim to be transforming into clean energy companies. Given a history of obstructive climate actions and “greenwashing”, there is a need to objectively evaluate current and historical decarbonization efforts and investment behavior. This study focuses on two American (Chevron, ExxonMobil) and two European majors (BP, Shell). Using data collected over 2009–2020, we comparatively examine the extent of decarbonization and clean energy transition activity from three perspectives: (1) keyword use in annual reports (discourse); (2) business strategies (pledges and actions); and (3) production, expenditures and earnings for fossil fuels along with investments in clean energy (investments). We found a strong increase in discourse related to “climate”, “low-carbon” and “transition”, especially by BP and Shell. Similarly, we observed increasing tendencies toward strategies related to decarbonization and clean energy. But these are dominated by pledges rather than concrete actions. Moreover, the financial analysis reveals a continuing business model dependence on fossil fuels along with insignificant and opaque spending on clean energy. We thus conclude that the transition to clean energy business models is not occurring, since the magnitude of investments and actions does not match discourse. Until actions and investment behavior are brought into alignment with discourse, accusations of greenwashing appear well-founded.\nCitation: Li M, Trencher G, Asuka J (2022) The clean energy claims of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell: A mismatch between discourse, actions and investments.

Introduction\nEfforts to limit planetary warming to below 2°C or 1.5°C entail a transition to net-zero-emissions energy systems by 2050 [1]. This carries vast implications for fossil fuel producers. Twenty fossil fuel companies are responsible for 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane emissions worldwide since 1965 [2, 3]. The leading investor-owned emitter is Chevron, followed closely by Exxon, BP, and Shell. The products of these four energy giants account for more than 10% of global carbon emissions since 1965 [2, 3].\nAs the world shifts away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change and air pollution, oil majors’ historically prosperous business models must grapple with the likelihood of decreased demand for hydrocarbons and fewer opportunities for profit [4], especially since the pandemic situation [5]. Symbolically illustrating this, in 2020, ExxonMobil dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index after nearly a century [6]. Meanwhile, electric-vehicle maker Tesla’s market value reached US $800 billion, propelling CEO Elon Musk to the status of the world’s richest man [7]. BP even suggested that oil demand may already have peaked [8]. Multiple developments are driving this shift. These include the electrification of road transport and government policies aiming to phase out internal combustion engines [9], divestment targeting the fossil fuel industry [10], climate policies targeting fossil fuel extraction and usage [11, 12] as well as government-led lawsuits and inquiries (including the U.S. Congress) against oil companies for delaying climate action and disseminating misinformation [13–17]. To survive in this changing market, oil majors face an urgent need to transition to a carbon-free business model [18, 19]. Indeed, some suggest that to meet the Paris Agreement goals, no additional CO2-emitting fossil fuel infrastructure should be commissioned, and early retirement of existing projects is required [1].\nOil majors have made both proactive and regressive steps toward this. Recently, some have begun investing in renewables and low-carbon technology [18, 20]. Many have announced various targets to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations or products [21] while stating public support for carbon pricing [22, 23]. Some—such as BP and Repsol—even claim to be transitioning to clean energy [3].\nHowever, historical behavior suggests that the authenticity of such claims should be examined critically and exhaustively. Multiple studies document how oil majors have strategically spread misinformation and aggressively obstructed progress toward climate action. ExxonMobil is a flagrant example, having strategically denied climate change and propagated disinformation to mislead the public for over 20 years [24–26]. Multiple majors have tried to shift the responsibility for climate change onto consumers (BP’s promotion of reducing individual carbon footprints is one example) [25, 27, 28]. The biggest American and European majors have also spent millions lobbying to delay or weaken climate policy [3, 15, 29]. Recently, oil majors are observed to be using advertising on social media platforms to influence public opinion and promote an image of green fossil fuels [30]. Research [3, 31] finds that even the most ambitious majors are simply mitigating future carbon risks by diversifying energy products rather than pursuing company-wide decarbonization. Given this track record, decarbonization claims by oil majors have been critiqued as “greenwashing” [32–34]. This is where corporate strategies—especially discourse and pledges to stakeholders—depict proactive actions that exceed a company’s actual environmental performance [35, 36].\nThis situation points to a strong need to comprehensively investigate the actual state of actions by oil majors to decarbonize and transition to clean energy. Previous scholarship has tackled this from diverse but disparate perspectives. This includes societal accountability [22, 23], the spreading of climate disinformation [24], lobbying [29, 37], emissions reductions efforts for operations and downstream products [38, 39] and renewables investment [21, 40]. Some recent studies focus on broader efforts to transition business models and phase out fossil fuel production [41].\nThis literature has limitations. Typically focusing on a single year [21, 22, 38, 42], prevalent approaches cannot fully identify the evolving nature of decarbonization trajectories. A long-term perspective is critical, since fossil fuel majors differ from smaller entities, whose transition strategies might proceed faster. Additionally, most research focuses on public statements or a narrow range of business strategies [22]. This hampers the ability to comprehensively monitor the complex and intertwined strategies making up a clean energy transition. Relying only on public statements alone also risks overestimating a company’s performance due to greenwashing tactics. Thus, objectively examining the extent of transition strategies by oil majors requires a multi-year approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data.\nThis study, therefore, assesses the extent to which oil majors are divesting from fossil fuels and transitioning toward clean energy. Focusing on four—ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and Chevron—we examine behavior from three perspectives: (1) discourse: frequency of climate- and clean-energy-related keyword use in annual reports; (2) strategies: pledges and actions related to decarbonization and clean energy and (3) investments: production, expenditures and earnings for fossil fuels as well as investments in clean energy. The analysis covers over a decade of activity (2009–2020), using publicly available qualitative and quantitative data.\nOur scholarly contribution is two-fold. Empirically, we reveal the actual extent to which each major is moving toward a clean-energy-based business model. Theoretically, our analytical framework can be used or built on by scholars to measure the transition behavior of other fossil fuel-centric industries.\n2. Methods\n2.1 Sample selection\nFour oil majors were selected for analysis: two from the US (Chevron, ExxonMobil) and two from Europe (BP, Shell). Together with Total, ConocoPhillips, and Eni, they comprise a larger group of seven international oil companies listed on the American and European stock markets [4]. We selected these four for two reasons. First, based on product-based GHG emissions since 1965, this group represents the top-ranking emitters among all investor-owned energy majors. Second, the balance of two American and two European majors allows analysis of contrasting attitudes and responses to the energy transition. Specifically, prior research [31, 41–43] has shown the American majors as resistant or obstructive, and the European companies as slightly more proactive.\n2.2 Study design and methods\nThe aim of this study is to assess the extent to which the above four oil majors are transitioning from a business model based primarily on fossil fuels towards one based on clean energy. In line with literature [44, 45], we expect this transition to involve a continual and multi-year process whereby oil and gas businesses are gradually contracted while investments in renewables are expanded, eventually replacing fossil fuel extraction and sales. We also expect the ultimate goal of such a transition to be net-zero; to eliminate all GHG emissions that result from the production or use of energy products [4, 46]. To measure and compare each major’s transition activities, in accord with our triple analysis of discourse, strategies and investments, our study design consists of the following three steps and sets of assumptions. Data for all steps covers the 12-year study period 2009–2020.\nThe first step examines the frequency of 39 keywords in annual reports published during the study period (Table 1). Following literature [47], we counted the frequency of each term and variants, dividing by the total word count in each report to normalize results. Terms were identified first from oil-industry grey literature [4, 48, 49] then organized into four categories: (i) climate change, focused on detecting awareness of climate-related concepts; (ii) transition, examining discourse reflecting a resolve to transition business models; (iii) emissions, showing acknowledgment of the need to reduce various GHG emissions; and (iv) clean energy, reflecting statements related to investments in non-fossil fuel or decarbonized energies. These categories capture the cognition of four key perspectives deemed essential to the clean-energy transformation of the oil industry.\n\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263596.t001\nIn selecting this approach, we assume that the frequency by which keywords are used will provide a rough proxy for the degree of awareness and importance placed on these issues [50]. Not overlooking the possibility of greenwashing [51], we view discourse and attention to climate and clean-energy issues as a precursor to concrete actions like investments and organizational transformation [52]. We focus on annual reports because they are the most official and representative of the various documents written to shareholders and stakeholders, and because their consistent year-to-year format is well suited to comparisons.\nS1 File details our procedure for selecting and omitting keywords. S1 Dataset contains all data collected and processed for this step.\nOur second step identifies and compares the annual status of strategies reflecting a transition towards a clean-energy business model. We sourced 25 indicators from academic and grey literature (Table 2) and organized these into four categories. These capture the presence of pledges and disclosure (14 indicators; shown as “P&D”) as well as concrete actions (11 indicators; shown as “A”). When referring to indicators, we use codes. For example, “BM1-P&D” refers to indicator 1 (pledges and disclosure) of the business model category.\n\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263596.t002\n2.2.2.1 Climate-change cognition (CC). Providing the intellectual justification to take action, these indicators serve as preconditions or predictors for pursuing a transition to clean energy [22]. The first two measure the presence of official statements acknowledging the link between human activities and climate change (CC1-P&D) and the need to reduce either emissions from fossil fuel combustion or production volumes (CC2-P&D). Next, participation in industry coalitions for decarbonization has incited pro-climate behavior amongst oil majors [31]. We thus measure participation in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) (CC3-A) due to its status as the leading global framework for guiding the oil industry’s response to climate change [48, 53]. We also examine recognition of two risks related to climate change: regulatory and market (CC4-P&D, CC5-P&D).\n2.2.2.2 Business model (BM). This category measures the presence of a concrete transition strategy (BM1-P&D and BM2-A), along with pledges and actions to reduce exploration or production of non-sequestered fossil fuels due to climate concerns (BM3-P&D to BM6-A) and to transition the workforce to clean-energy businesses (BM7-P&D and BM8-A). We measure support for government carbon-pricing policies (BM9-P&D) and the introduction of carbon costs into internal decision-making (BM10-A). These strategies are widely recognized as indicating a shift toward clean energy [54–59].\n2.2.2.3 Emissions reduction (ER). This category measures the presence of pledges and actions to reduce GHG emissions. Since the concrete goal of achieving zero emissions by 2050 is shared globally [60, 61], we evaluate if each major pledges to reach net-zero on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner (ER1-P&D, ER2-A). Observing the growing importance of reducing the GHG emissions resulting from end-user combustion of energy products [4, 62, 63], we evaluate the presence of pledges and strategies to reduce scope 3 emissions intensity (ER3-P&D, ER4-A). We also search for multi-year ambitions and strategies to reduce methane emissions (ER5-P&D, ER6-A), and complete disclosure of all GHG emissions for scope 1, 2, and 3 (ER7-P&D).\nIn designing these indicators, we exclude targets to reduce GHG emissions and actual emissions performance each year. This reflects the view that relative emissions per unit of output are naturally decreasing due to technical improvements in operation [3,43], and that absolute emissions each year are principally determined by hydrocarbon production volumes. Thus, focusing on these annually declining emissions metrics would not reveal behavior consistent with a transition to clean energy.\n2.2.2.4 Clean energy investment (CE). This category emphasizes investments in renewables—the core driver of transition [64]. We measure whether each major transparently discloses the annual volume of investments made in clean energy (CE1-A), and whether this is above 1% of total CAPEX (CE2-P&D, CE3-A). This highly conservative 1% threshold follows observations that investment volumes by oil majors, being still outside their core business areas, have been consistently less than this amount [4].\nData to apply this framework was sourced from annual reports, sustainability reports, and energy-transition reports published by each major during the study period. Based on quantitative or collective evidence, we evaluated each major’s actions using numerical scoring:\nWe provide concrete examples of scoring decisions for all indicators in (S2 File).\nAdditionally, all data collected and examined for this step is available in (S2–S5 Datasets).\nThe third step analyzes financial-performance data collected from each major’s annual reports over the study period. This tracks changes in annual financial activity in six areas: (i) CAPEX for upstream businesses related to fossil fuels (i.e. oil and gas), which includes exploration, field development and production, midstream transportation, storage and processing, and the marketing and trading of oil and natural gas, (ii) associated earnings, (iii) fossil fuel production volumes, (iv) fossil fuel reserve estimates, (v) downstream sales, and (xi) CAPEX in clean-energy production and technologies. In processing data, we mainly use ratios instead of absolute volumes. Relative amounts (i.e. ratios) are better suited to showing the structure of each major’s earnings and production portfolio, since absolute volumes (e.g. CAPEX, fossil fuels sales) vary significantly each year with changing market situations (e.g. oil prices).\nFirst, analysis of CAPEX volumes shows each major’s annual spending—through acquisition, upgrading, and maintenance—on fixed assets supporting the upstream production of oil and gas (original data is reported as millions of dollars). We calculate the percentage of fossil fuel-related CAPEX relative to total CAPEX, which also includes downstream and other capital outlays. Collection of this data is based on expectations that a major undergoing transition would reduce CAPEX volumes for upstream fossil fuel production, channeling investments toward clean-energy businesses [71].\nSecond, analysis of total annual fossil fuel earnings reveals the business model’s dependence on fossil fuels. We report absolute earnings in millions of dollars first, then convert each to a relative share of total earnings. Again, we assume that both absolute and relative volumes of upstream earnings from fossil fuels would decline during a clean-energy transition. We expect this to occur as each major achieves a greater relative share of earnings from clean energy instead of fossil fuels [72]. Conversely, we expect that a higher dependence on fossil fuels for total earnings would reduce the economic rationale to transition [73, 74].\nThird, analysis of average daily production volumes for oil (i.e. liquids) and gas is firstly shown as units of one thousand barrels per day for liquids, and millions of cubic feet per day for gas. In addition to showing combined annual production of oil and gas, we convert each to an incremental percentage, setting 2009 as the baseline. This allows us to minimize the influence of fossil fuel price fluctuation, since we focus on production volumes instead of sale revenues. Underpinning this analysis is the logic that curbing the supply of fossil fuels is crucial for meeting the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement [66, 75]; and that majors might choose to increase gas production due to its lower carbon intensity than oil [76].\nFourth, analysis of each major’s annual estimates of oil and gas reserves is based on original data reported as millions of barrels for liquids, and billions of cubic feet for gas. We again change to an incremental percentage, setting 2009 volumes as the baseline. In including this dimension, we expect those majors with greater fossil fuel reserves to experience the largest difficulties with leaving these assets in the ground, because of their financial value to share prices and future production [77–79].\nFifth, analysis of annual downstream petroleum sales is based on original data reported as one thousand barrels per day for refined oil, and one thousand tons per day for chemicals. We focus again on sales volumes of refined oil and chemicals, converting data to an incremental ratio, setting 2009 as the baseline. Here we assume that the reduced sale of processed hydrocarbon products, being a principal source of scope 3 emissions alongside unrefined oil and gas, would be another important goal for transitioning to a clean-energy-based business model [80].\nSixth, we compare two types of data for renewable energy investments: (i) expenditures in renewables production and technology development, shown as a share of total CAPEX; and (ii) renewable electricity generation capacity, shown as megawatts (MW). Data is not fully disclosed in annual reports, obliging us to use third-party sources, whose data shows only cumulative rather than annual trends. Specifically, CAPEX data sourced from CDP (2019) and Fletcher et al. (2018) [67, 81] shows only cumulative investments from 2010 to the third quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, data on renewable-electricity capacity, sourced from the Standard & Poor’s Global Platts website and database [82], shows only total amounts from 2009–2019.\nAll data collected and processed for this step is available in (S6 Dataset).\n3. Findings\n3.1 Discourse\nFig 1 shows the normalized results of the discourse analysis: the frequency of 39 keywords in annual reports. All majors show a clear increasing trend over the study period, most notably the European majors, particularly in the “transition” and “emissions” categories. Findings reflect an amplification of discourse about mitigating GHG emissions and increasing clean energy businesses.\nNote: Results for ExxonMobil are affected by the style of reports examined (all years except 2020 are summary reports).\n\nNote: Results for ExxonMobil are affected by the style of reports examined (all years except 2020 are summary reports).\n\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263596.g001\nShell is the only company showing a marked increase in all four categories over the study period, displaying a clean “J” curve. Notable keywords include “low-carbon energy” (increasing almost ten-fold, from 59 to 503 mentions), “renewable” (3 to 91), and “clean” (9 to 82). This shift in oral discourse is also visible in the evolving messages from Shell’s chairpersons. For example, in 2009, Jorma Ollila stated ambitions to produce more oil and natural gas to meet global energy demands [83, 84]. This was flipped in 2020, as Chad Holliday pledged a reoriented mission, to “play an essential role in the move to a cleaner, lower-carbon world” [83].\nBP also shows a marked increase in keyword usage over the study period, especially in 2019. In contrast to Shell’s steadily rising trend, BP’s follows a “U” curve, with low points between 2012 and 2017. BP has increased usage of words in the “climate change” category in particular, from 22 to 326 mentions over 2009–2020. The “transition” category also increased markedly in the study period, from 50 to 418, reflecting increased discussion of a low-carbon business model. In 2009 the CEO considered BP an “oil company”, whereas in 2021, BP advocated transforming into an “integrated energy company” and pledged a transition to net-zero emissions [84].\nChevron is the only major not showing a noticeable increase. It trails the European majors in all categories, particularly “climate” and “transition”. The word “climate” was mentioned only 45 times for the entire study period and was missing from annual reports in 2009–2011. This compares to 171 mentions by BP in 2020 alone. Chevron’s lagging performance is also indicated by mention of “renewables”. This appears only in the glossary of terms of the 2009 annual report, and climbs to just 19 mentions in 2019 [85], compared to 92 times by BP.\nInterpreting ExxonMobil’s results requires caution. This major increased its usage of keywords after 2014. But this is likely influenced by the style of annual reports. While the other three majors release full reports each year, ExxonMobil published only summaries (except 2020). Considering that total normalized keyword usage dips markedly in 2020 (when a full report was available), for other years, results appear to be inflated by the brevity of annual-report summaries. This aside, ExxonMobil’s results show an increase in discourse on “emissions” and “low carbon” energy. But the low frequency of keyword mentions in the “climate change” and “transition” categories reflects low attention to these issues. This differs from the European majors, where results in the “transition” category increase markedly. Furthermore, ExxonMobil’s use of several keywords is erratic. For example, in the “emissions” category, although “CO2” was mentioned 10 times in 2009 and 11 times in 2020, it was not found between 2011 and 2013.\n3.2 Strategies: Pledges and actions\nThis section applies the framework explained in Section 2.2.3 and Table 2 to evaluate the state of pledges and concrete business actions that indicate a shift to clean energy. Results for each major appear in Fig 2A and 2B. The differing trajectories of pledges and actions appear in Fig 3. Detailed supporting evidence is provided in (S2–S5 Datasets). When discussing findings, we refer to indicators with codes explained in the Methods (Section 2.2.2).\n(a) Business strategy analysis for European majors. (b) Business strategy analysis for American majors. Note on scores: “+1” indicates pledges and actions that implement or reinforce a strategy or commitment in that year; “-1” indicates pledges and actions that contradict or hamper a strategy or commitment in that year; and “0” indicates that no evidence of pledges and actions in either direction was found.\n\n(a) Business strategy analysis for European majors.

Only in 2018 did ExxonMobil recognize, indirectly and weakly, the link between fossil fuels and climate change in its annual report—and this position did not carry over into the 2020 version. Meanwhile, from 2011 to 2017, Chevron conceded in its corporate responsibility report that “use of fossil fuels to meet the world’s energy needs contributes to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere” [86]. Yet this acknowledgment vanished from later versions.\nIn contrast, the European majors have consistently acknowledged the link between fossil fuels and climate change. For Shell, this began in 2010 and evolved into stronger annual-report statements from 2015 on, such as: “We have long recognized that the use of fossil fuels contributes to climate change” [87]. BP follows a similar trend: its acknowledgment of climate change begins weakly in sustainability reports from 2010 [88], and evolves into stronger statements from 2012 on, such as: “action is needed to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases being emitted through fossil fuel use” [89].\nFor both the American and European majors, we find scant acknowledgment of the need to shift away from or reduce dependence on all types of non-sequestered fossil fuels (CC2-P&D). Overall, statements consistently argue the reverse. For example, from 2014, ExxonMobil began to reject the need to reduce emissions from hydrocarbon development [90], even strengthening this position in 2020: “With respect to energy supply, production reductions by individual companies would have no impact on demand or consumption of energy, and would simply result in production shifting from one producer to another” [91]. Chevron expresses similar views, stating as recently as 2019 that “a decrease in overall fossil fuel emissions is not inconsistent with continued or increased fossil fuel production by the most efficient producers” [92]. The European majors show a similar pattern of rejecting the need to transition away from non-sequestered fossil fuels. BP communicated in its annual report 2019 that producing more gas was consistent with a net-zero future [8]. This only changed in 2020, when BP announced the intention to reduce all fossil fuel production as part of its energy transition [84].\nAs the only indicator for action in this category, participation in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (CC3-A), established in 2014, indicates more rapid acknowledgment by the European majors of the need to begin the energy transition. Specifically, BP and Shell joined in 2015, three years before ExxonMobil and Chevron.\nFinally, BP, Shell, and Chevron have actively disclosed climate-related regulatory risk since 2009 (CC4-P&D). Shell was the first to consistently acknowledge both regulatory and market risks from climate change in its annual reports. For the other three, disclosure of market risk (CC5-P&D) has probably lagged due to views that renewables would not pose a significant threat to hydrocarbon businesses in the short term [90, 93].\nFor the business model category, support for government carbon-pricing policies (BM9-P&D) and adoption of an internal carbon price for decision-making purposes (BM10-A) are the only areas where consistent activity is observed over the study period. BP and Shell have introduced carbon pricing into decision-making, each setting $40 per ton [88, 94]. Though ExxonMobil’s support for carbon policies dates back to at least 2009 [95], continuous consideration of carbon pricing in internal business decisions (BM10-A) did not occur until 2017.\nFor other indicators, evidence of a business-model transition toward clean energy is thin, appearing only after 2018. Only the European majors explicitly mention a commitment to shifting be","{'tone': 'Analytical', 'sentiment': 'Positive', 'summary': 'The comments express a generally positive sentiment towards fossil fuels and their role in the development and prosperity of humanity over the past two centuries.'}","['The article concludes that there is a mismatch between the discourse, actions, and investments of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell in transitioning to clean energy. While the discourse and pledges of the European majors BP and Shell indicate a greater focus on climate change and clean energy, their actual investments and actions do not match this rhetoric. The American majors Chevron and ExxonMobil lag behind in both discourse and concrete efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. The authors argue that until the words, actions, and investments of these oil majors are aligned, accusations of ""greenwashing"" are well-founded. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263596']"

Abstract
A critical charge for science to inform environmental protection is to characterize the risks associated with climate change, to support development of appropriate responses. The nature of climate change, however, presents significant challenges that must be overcome to do so, including the need for integration and synthesis across the many disciplines that contain knowledge relevant for achieving environmental protection goals. This paper describes an interdisciplinary research framework organized around three “Science Challenges” that directly respond to the needs of environmental protection organizations. Broadly, these Science Challenges refer to the research needed to: inform actions to enhance resilience across a broad range of environmental and social stresses to environmental management endpoints; actions to limit GHG emissions and slow the underlying rate of climate change; and the transition to sustainability across the full spectrum of climate change impacts and solutions; all as situated within an overarching risk management perspective. These Challenges span all media and systems critical to effective environmental protection, highlighting the cross-cutting nature of climate change and the need to address its impacts across systems and places. While this framework uses EPA’s programs as an illustrative example, the research directions articulated herein are broadly applicable across the spectrum of environmental protection organizations. Going forward, we recommend that climate-related research to inform environmental protection efforts should accelerate its evolution toward research that is inherently cross-media and cross-scale; explicitly considers the social dimensions of change; and focuses on designing solutions to the specific risks climate change poses to the environment and society.
Introduction
Climate change is a central concern of environmental protection because it poses substantial risks to societal interests in protecting—and legislated mandates to protect—air quality, water quality, public lands, ecosystems, and human health across multiple levels of governance. In addition, many environmental protection organizations have a statutory role in developing and implementing policies and regulations to control air pollutant emissions, including of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Finally, responses to climate change may also have environmental impacts of their own that will fall under the responsibilities of these organizations. Research intended to support environmental protection by providing the best available science to decision makers implementing national, state, provincial, tribal, and municipal environmental laws must take into account that such actions are now, and increasingly will be, influenced by climate change.
This paper puts forward a framework for the climate-related research needed to most effectively support environmental protection with the intention of facilitating dialog and engagement with the broader scientific community. This framework envisions integration and synthesis of relevant knowledge streams from multiple disciplines around key scientific questions central to environmental protection in the face of long-term climate change. The paper begins by reviewing the unique and significant challenges posed by climate change to institutional environmental quality and public health missions, challenges that encompass the analytic tools and methods of public health and environmental risk assessment. It then outlines three major “Science Challenges” that can serve as organizing principles for such research going forward, both in terms of bringing together existing insights from multiple disciplines to help address environmental protection needs today, as well as new research that can help fill critical research gaps, and key integrative elements that cut across these three Challenges.
Background: The Challenge Climate Change Poses for Environmental Protection
Over the next few decades, climate change is expected to intensify current air and water quality issues and increase stresses on public health and environmental systems (U.S. EPA 2009, 2012; USGCRP 2016, 2018). Managing these trends will involve applying, and potentially adapting, regulatory and other environmental management mechanisms to ensure their continued effectiveness in an environment with shifting temperatures, more frequent and severe heavy rainfall events, longer and deeper droughts, larger and more widespread wildfires, rising seas, and ocean acidification (IPCC 2014a; Melillo et al. 2014; USGCRP 2017, 2018). It also will involve assessing the systemic environmental threats posed by accelerating climate change and designing and implementing actions to manage them. Characterizing both specific and system-wide risks from climate change, and supporting the development of appropriate response options, is therefore a critical charge for organizations whose mission it is to ensure environmental quality and associated public health outcomes. The unique nature of the climate change problem, however, presents significant challenges for such efforts that ultimately must be overcome if these organizations are to maintain efficient and effective policy and decision-making in the face of climate change (Morgan et al. 1999; Sussman et al. 2014). This charge, and set of challenges, is situated within a larger conversation about the value of framing climate change, as a scientific-societal issue, from within a risk perspective (Sutton 2019; Weaver et al. 2017; King et al. 2015), a conversation in which environmental protection organizations should be expected to play a leading role, given their extensive experience with environmental risk assessment and risk management.
Developed over a long and successful application to critical environmental problems, risk assessment methods, practices, and tools have provided the foundation for the ability of EPA and other environmental protection organizations to leverage the best available science in meeting their missions to protect human health and the environment (Ruckelshaus 1983; NRC 1983, 1996). Combining approaches and methodologies from fields such as human exposure research, environmental toxicology, and epidemiology, the risk assessment paradigm has served as a coherent framework for the environmental protection community to identify and manage hazardous exposures in populations and ecosystems from pollutants and toxins in the environment. Nevertheless, the expected and potential impacts of climate change challenge traditional risk assessment in five fundamental ways.
First, climate change calls into question the assumption of stationarity, which explicitly or implicitly underpins a wide array of risk assessment tools and methods (Milly et al. 2008). Stationarity assumes that the future is a close statistical analog of the past, and that past climatic conditions therefore provide the basis for projecting future impacts and developing corresponding policy responses. Increasingly, though, this assumption is no longer valid as weather and climate conditions move beyond the envelope of observed patterns within which all environmental regulations and management practices have been developed and implemented (USGCRP 2017). Climate change also is likely to alter causal links between processes affecting pollutant formation and transport and subsequent health and ecosystem effects (e.g., Greaver et al. 2016). Furthermore, because climate change is a global phenomenon, potentially affecting everything, everywhere, with impacts that cut across geographic region, ecosystem type, population group, or socioeconomic sector, it challenges traditional, media-specific regulatory boundaries. This inability to assume stationarity thus applies to risk assessment within and across all such media and systems.
Second, while great scientific advances have been made over the last few decades in climate science, this nonstationarity challenge is compounded by remaining large and often hard-to-characterize uncertainties associated with future climate change and its impacts (Lempert et al. 2004; Weaver et al. 2013). These uncertainties result from limitations on the predictability of specific consequences of climate change due to the complexity of key climate system processes and forcings, including potentially large but uncertain climate feedbacks, the uncertain trajectory of future GHG emissions, and natural, internal variability of the climate system (Hawkins and Sutton 2009). Although there is growing confidence in the long-term, global-scale consequences of climate change, limits on climate system predictability are experienced most strongly at precisely the space and time-scales most relevant for environmental management, such as the regional and local scales of watersheds and communities, or for short-term extremes such as stagnation episodes and heavy rainfall events (Dawson et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2015). What this means in practical terms is that, not only is the past no longer a reliable guide to the future, but our ability to project into the future through other means, such as model simulations, also has limits. Applying new approaches to risk assessment and management will therefore often be necessary if we wish to overcome these constraints (Weaver et al. 2013).
Third, basing long-term environmental protection planning on “most likely” or “best-guess” future conditions is no longer fully appropriate in the context of climate change. Core principles of risk management applied across a diverse range of sectors, from insurance and finance, to aircraft and power plant safety, recommend planning approaches based on limiting the risks of catastrophic damages, not just damages resulting from marginal shifts in average conditions (Kunreuther et al. 2013; de Perez et al. 2014; Heal and Millner 2014). What is clear is that climate change will shift the distributions of key metrics like temperature and precipitation, significantly increasing both the frequency and severity of extreme meteorological conditions locally, as well as the potential for worst-case scenarios, in terms of melting ice and carbon cycle feedbacks (NRC 2013). Accounting for such shifts is critically important in assessing and managing overall climate-related risk, since the total risk from climate change is not symmetrical with respect to the distribution of future outcomes, but is instead heavily skewed toward low-probability, high-consequence futures (Hinkel et al. 2015; King et al. 2015).
Fourth, most of the risks from climate change result not from the direct toxicity of GHGs, as with other pollutants, but through the diversity of effects due to warming-induced shifts in weather patterns and baseline environmental conditions (one exception is ocean acidification). Such shifts can be direct (e.g., flooding due to heavy rainfall or sea level rise) or indirect (e.g., changes in ecosystem structure and function), each of which can affect human health and human systems (IPCC 2014a; Melillo et al. 2014). Although the proximal effect of increasing emissions is a global increase in GHG concentrations and global-mean temperature, specific impacts can be highly local, with the populations experiencing the greatest impacts in many cases not those generating the most significant GHG emissions. Furthermore, climate change impacts on a given management endpoint will be the result of complex interactions among these climatic stressors and other, nonclimatic stressors that also change over time. These interactions include the intersection between phenomena occurring over multiple space and time-scales: for example, the implications for terrestrial ecosystems of an increasing frequency of heat waves, leading to heat stress, drought, and vegetation-damaging high ozone events, combined with a longer growing season, expanding ranges of pest and invasive species, and more frequent and intense wildland fires (USGCRP 2018). Such climate-driven changes in forests and other land ecosystems also have the potential to affect water quality by reducing the natural capacity of those ecosystems to process pollutants. These multistressor interactions also include the joint impacts of changing climate and simultaneous socioeconomic trends, such as in population and demographics, land use, nutrient inputs, economic growth, technological innovation, and even adaptation responses to climate change (Bierwagen et al. 2010; Georgescu et al. 2014). Climate change is a “risk multiplier” that interacts with other stressors to create new, or alter existing, risks (DoD 2014). Many of the greatest potential risks from climate change will be a consequence of cascading (or cumulative) impacts and feedbacks among these interlinked components in ways that are hard to anticipate. This complexity confounds simple causation models, making more difficult the development of robust exposure assessments and risk characterization in support of rulemaking.
Fifth, the climate change problem challenges our ability to value the full range of impacts, quantitatively or sometimes even qualitatively (USGCRP 2011; Sussman et al. 2014). Though some recent efforts have improved our ability to quantify certain economic impacts of climate change (U.S. EPA 2015; Risky Business Project 2014; O’Neill et al. 2017), there are many other types of impacts that are more difficult to capture with the economic valuation methods used in these studies. For example, some impacts, such as loss of cultural heritage, are largely intangible, and therefore difficult to define and measure, but represent meaningful losses nevertheless. In addition, the most severe potential impacts challenge fundamental assumptions of marginality (along with other core precepts of economic analysis) and are thus difficult to capture accurately as damage functions in current large-scale economic models (Weitzman 2011; Weyant 2014). Furthermore, because of the long lag built into the climate system between emissions and the experience of the largest impacts, the consequences of both climate change, and the policy choices made today in response, will span decades to generations. The result is an unprecedented degree of long-range thinking called for in policy and planning, with close attention paid to the challenging economic problems of intergenerational equity and discounting (Heal 2009).
The inertia of the climate system is such that impacts may remain manageable, if increasingly severe, for the next few decades under plausible scenarios of GHG emissions—at least for the developed world (see, however, Xu et al. (2018) about the potential for global warming to accelerate over the next two decades). Beyond this time, however, if cumulative GHG concentrations continue to build in the atmosphere, rapidly increasing global temperatures are expected to drive increasingly large changes in extreme weather, sea level, and ecosystem response, with associated impacts beyond what all countries, developed and developing, may be able to readily manage (Lenton et al. 2008; NRC 2013). Avoiding the worst of these impacts, and averting potentially catastrophic tipping points in physical, biological, and socioeconomic systems, seemingly implies that within a few short decades we will need to restructure our global energy system to bring emissions of GHGs rapidly to near zero (IPCC 2014b). Such an enormous undertaking would itself be expected to profoundly affect society and the environment. Because of the inter-connectedness of natural and human systems, the environmental effects of technologies and interventions deployed to mitigate the causes of climate change would likely create challenges for environmental health and human well-being that would also need to be managed, and hence would themselves become the concern of environmental protection organizations. In other words, we soon will be faced with either transformational impacts or transformational responses—and likely a combination thereof. Both will challenge environmental protection efforts in ways that transcend any policy precedent.
Implicit throughout the previous discussion is the need to understand linked biophysical and social processes of change, and to do so in a way that supports societal responses to this change (Hackmann et al. 2014). This means that planning and implementing climate change-related research to inform environmental protection will require integrating the full range of disciplinary perspectives and contributions from across the scientific enterprise, including the disciplines spanning the social and behavioral sciences. It is people, and their communities, institutions, and governments, who are key drivers of climate change. In addition, climate change impacts ultimately depend on social context. And climate change solutions, both in terms of reducing emissions and increasing resilience, will require greater understanding of how decisions are made by individuals and communities; the key characteristics of socio-environmental systems that lead to reduced vulnerability and enhanced resilience to climate change impacts; and the nature of sustainable environmental management under conditions of change, transition, and transformation (Dunlap and Brulle 2015). The future of climate-related research in support of environmental protection should thus explicitly recognize and incorporate the social sciences as both an important part of the integrated knowledge base for understanding the causes, consequences of, and solutions for climate change and its impacts, and a source of guiding principles that can help put this knowledge to work (Weaver et al. 2014).
Three Science Challenges
These challenges of climate change as it intersects with organizational missions to protect public health and the environment, just discussed, define a space for climate-related environmental protection research efforts. As articulated, climate change poses significant near- and long-term challenges to achieving these missions, and to the traditional methods and practices by which EPA and analogous organizations conduct science-informed policy and decision-making. Drawing on a prior articulation of this research framing (see U.S. EPA 2017), while generalizing to apply more broadly across the spectrum of environmental protection organizations and efforts, these challenges, and the research portfolio needed to address them, can be organized into three distinct, high-level categories of research effort, summarized as follows:


Broadly, these Science Challenges refer to the research needed to inform (1) adaptation actions to enhance resilience across a broad range of environmental and social stresses and continue to deliver clean air, clean water, and healthy communities and ecosystems in the face of climate change, (2) mitigation actions to limit GHG emissions and slow the underlying rate of climate change, and (3) the transition to sustainability across the full spectrum of climate change impacts and solutions. These “big bins” of climate-related research for environmental protection span media and systems, highlighting both the cross-cutting nature of climate change and the corresponding need to address its impacts across multiple policy domains simultaneously. The boundaries between these Science Challenges are fluid—and they represent a progression. For example, quantitatively assessing the range of benefits and costs of GHG policies, under Science Challenge 2, will require leveraging the full suite of media-, system-, and sector-focused climate impacts research carried out under Science Challenge 1. Similarly, research related to vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation on the one hand, and the environmental impacts of mitigation options and practices on the other, provide crucial bridges from Science Challenges 1 and 2 to the exploration of long-term, sustainable solutions under Science Challenge 3.
To fully support decision-makers in addressing climate change within their environmental protection missions, scientific efforts falling under these Challenges necessarily represent a balance across different modes and phases of research, including laboratory and field measurements, model development, synthesis and assessment, and development of decision support tools. It also must represent engagement and science translation around existing and newly emerging data, tools, and findings, often involving integration of key insights or data streams from across typically disparate disciplines, as well as complementary long-term, exploratory research—“horizon scanning”—in anticipation of future decision maker needs.
In the following subsections, we discuss the specific research topics underlying each of these three Science Challenges, highlight critical research gaps that will need to be addressed in the near term, and identify key integrative elements that point the way toward a long-term synthesis.
Science Challenge 1
The large-scale, long-term changes in Earth’s climate due to increasing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere manifest themselves, locally and over shorter time-scales, as shifts in the statistics of a wide array of weather- and climate-related extremes (Herring et al. 2016; USGCRP 2017; Wobus et al. 2018; Sanderson et al. 2019). That such extremes—including heat waves, heavy rainfall events, droughts, wildfires, stagnation events, hurricanes, and winter storms—strongly influence air quality, water quality, human health, community vulnerability, and ecosystem integrity and services is well understood (USGCRP 2018), even though the pathways connecting these meteorological and climatological phenomena with ecological and human systems can be complex. In addition, increasing global temperatures caused by rising GHG concentrations drive trends in key baseline environmental conditions closely tied to environmental protection organizational missions, including increased proportions of precipitation falling as rain versus snow, lengthening of the growing season, elevated stream temperatures, sea level rise, permafrost melting, and ocean acidification (Melillo et al. 2014; U.S. EPA 2016c; USGCRP 2018). Many of these impacts can interact with each other to drive additional environmental changes, and/or have effects that cut across a range of media-specific endpoints, such as the direct and indirect role of wildfires in air quality, terrestrial ecosystems, and water quality.
The immediate challenge is to understand how the profound changes in driving climate conditions, both means and extremes, are now affecting, and will increasingly affect, water and air quality, ecosystems, and human health and communities, given the loss of stationarity and deep uncertainty about future changes. These insights into the diverse environmental impacts of climate change are a foundational need for improving the scientific support provided to the development and implementation of regulations, guidance, tools, and capabilities for managing these impacts as they evolve.
Successfully addressing Science Challenge 1 relies, first, on integrating the existing research strengths of the public health and environmental sciences communities with the complementary research carried out within the climate science community (e.g., see Anderson et al. 2019). Research that falls under Science Challenge 1 uses scientific information on the changing statistics of climate, leveraging analysis of observed trends as well as outputs from climate model simulations, and integrates this knowledge base with observational and experimental data, modeling tools, and analytic approaches for assessing exposures, toxicity, and health outcomes. For example, to support the evaluation of climate change impacts within EPA, researchers build on core strengths in air pollution, watershed, and exposure modeling. A key task within this research portfolio is the adaptation of existing models (e.g., the Community Multiscale Air Quality model) for use in targeted assessments of vulnerabilities and emerging risks. Such model adaptation involves building capability within the models to assess climate change effects, e.g., by modifying them to receive future scenarios of key driving climate variables as inputs or by updating climate-sensitive model parameterizations. Other critical tasks include developing improved climate-related vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies; innovative decision analytic approaches and frameworks to help decision-makers manage uncertainties associated with future climate change; scenario products for use in these new approaches and frameworks; new indicators of system change to support monitoring and adaptive management under both climate change and other interacting stressors; and scientific syntheses of integrated climate change effects relevant for environmental management.
Table 1 provides examples, situated within an EPA context but more broadly applicable, of key research topics, and associated knowledge gaps, related to Science Challenge 1, organized according to their focus on specific media and type of impacts: including water quality, air quality, health, and ecosystems and land, while acknowledging that a priority direction for future research is to focus more strongly on interactions of effects across media and systems (see the Science Challenge 3 subsection ahead).
Table 1
Critical climate-related research topics and knowledge gaps under Science Challenge 1, by major environmental media (adapted and synthesized from research narratives provided in U.S. EPA 2017)
In addition to the media- and system-specific research gaps identified in Table 1, there are several conceptual and analytical challenges that cut across all media and systems. For example, climate change is only one of several linked, local-to-global changes that will affect the environment. These include changes in population and demographics, economic growth, technology, land use, biogeochemical cycles, and environmental toxins. A critical element of climate-related research for environmental protection must be to improve understanding of how these stressors interact and coevolve with climate change to alter climate-driven impacts (e.g., Post et al. 2012; Hewitt et al. 2016; Morefield et al. 2018). Similarly, climate change will likely impact multiple environmental management endpoints simultaneously. For example, climate change is likely to alter the fate and transport of toxic chemicals in the environment and even the sensitivity of humans and other organisms to their effects (Noyes et al. 2009; Balbus et al. 2013; Hooper et al. 2013), as well as increase risks to treatment infrastructure and waste sites, with corresponding public health consequences, as illustrated recently with hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017.
Furthermore, as already discussed, climate change calls into question the assumption of stationarity which underpins a broad range of risk assessment tools and approaches. Although challenging, this reality of the climate change problem does not preclude effective risk assessment and risk management. Much progress can be made by adapting and applying core principles of risk assessment in a climate change context (King et al. 2015; Weaver et al. 2017). These include working backward from identifying the type and magnitude of impacts that would create important risks, to then examine the scientific plausibility of climate change triggering those risks, including low-probability but high-consequence outcomes (Brown et al. 2011; Kunreuther et al. 2013). This perspective aligns with emerging thinking in other areas of concern in environmental protection, such as chemical risk assessment (e.g., see Gwinn et al. 2017). While this type of approach can help clarify the extent and timing of needed response actions, it will also create new demands on the kind of information needed from the climate science community—for example from climate models—potentially opening up new research avenues as well (Weaver et al. 2013).
Finally, as introduced earlier in the paper, a greater role for knowledge and expertise from a broad range of social sciences disciplines in research related to climate impacts on public health and environmental management endpoints has been recommended by multiple review bodies (e.g., BOSC 2016). In response, some environmental protection organizations, including EPA, have been increasing their efforts to integrate social sciences into their research programs in response (U.S. EPA 2016a; Costa and Hubbell 2016). For example, one major priority for this interdisciplinary integration under Science Challenge 1 should be to improve understanding of the disproportionate impacts of climate change on environmental justice communities, including Tribal communities and communities of color, that exacerbate existing disparities (e.g., Harlan et al. 2015; Maldonado et al. 2013; USGCRP, 2016; Mikati et al. 2018; USGCRP 2018).
Science Challenge 2
The basic need under Science Challenge 2 is for research to both inform the development, implementation, and assessment of actions, regulatory and otherwise, that effectively control emissions of GHGs and short-lived climate forcers over the long term, and improve understanding of the potential for both co-benefits and adverse impacts of these actions (Anenberg et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2014; Miller and Gage 2011; Poto_nik and Khosla 2016; Shindell et al. 2016; West et al. 2013). Research to date related to Science Challenge 2 has mainly fallen within the following categories: (1) emissions measurements and projections; (2) benefits assessment across multiple GHG emissions scenarios; and (3) analysis of the mutual co-benefits of air quality and GHG regulatory actions and transitions to alternative energy technologies. As with Science Challenge 1 and Table 1, Table 2 summarizes key research topics, and associated knowledge gaps, related to Science Challenge 2.

One major, cross-cutting research need is to improve understanding of how the environmental impacts of GHG emissions reduction strategies can become increasingly important as the scale of implementation grows. For instance, biofuels and natural gas have long been seen as important components of a long-term GHG mitigation strategy (Pacala and Socolow 2004; Winchester and Reilly 2015). As the production of these fuels has grown, however, environmental protection organizations have had to respond to environmental concerns over both these approaches, including changes in land use and nutrient runoff, and potential impacts on groundwater and air quality (U.S. EPA 2011; U.S. EPA 2016b; U.S. EPA 2018; Colburn et al. 2011; Vidic et al. 2013). More broadly, understanding the environmental consequences of GHG emissions reduction approaches, and developing methods to avoid adverse impacts, is critical to developing environmentally sustainable responses to climate change.
In addition, understanding the costs of mitigation must be accompanied by understanding the benefits (and co-benefits)","Leaked Trump Budget Would Slash EPA's Climate, Environment Spending","[""To virtually no-one's surprise."", ""As a non American It's frustrating yet amusing to listen to all the turmoil in the US but shit like budget cuts to the EPA affects everyone you fucking tards.

The nature of climate change, however, presents significant challenges that must be overcome to do so, including the need for integration and synthesis across the many disciplines that contain knowledge relevant for achieving environmental protection goals. This paper describes an interdisciplinary research framework organized around three “Science Challenges” that directly respond to the needs of environmental protection organizations. Broadly, these Science Challenges refer to the research needed to: inform actions to enhance resilience across a broad range of environmental and social stresses to environmental management endpoints; actions to limit GHG emissions and slow the underlying rate of climate change; and the transition to sustainability across the full spectrum of climate change impacts and solutions; all as situated within an overarching risk management perspective. These Challenges span all media and systems critical to effective environmental protection, highlighting the cross-cutting nature of climate change and the need to address its impacts across systems and places. While this framework uses EPA’s programs as an illustrative example, the research directions articulated herein are broadly applicable across the spectrum of environmental protection organizations. Going forward, we recommend that climate-related research to inform environmental protection efforts should accelerate its evolution toward research that is inherently cross-media and cross-scale; explicitly considers the social dimensions of change; and focuses on designing solutions to the specific risks climate change poses to the environment and society.\nIntroduction\nClimate change is a central concern of environmental protection because it poses substantial risks to societal interests in protecting—and legislated mandates to protect—air quality, water quality, public lands, ecosystems, and human health across multiple levels of governance. In addition, many environmental protection organizations have a statutory role in developing and implementing policies and regulations to control air pollutant emissions, including of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Finally, responses to climate change may also have environmental impacts of their own that will fall under the responsibilities of these organizations. Research intended to support environmental protection by providing the best available science to decision makers implementing national, state, provincial, tribal, and municipal environmental laws must take into account that such actions are now, and increasingly will be, influenced by climate change.\nThis paper puts forward a framework for the climate-related research needed to most effectively support environmental protection with the intention of facilitating dialog and engagement with the broader scientific community. This framework envisions integration and synthesis of relevant knowledge streams from multiple disciplines around key scientific questions central to environmental protection in the face of long-term climate change. The paper begins by reviewing the unique and significant challenges posed by climate change to institutional environmental quality and public health missions, challenges that encompass the analytic tools and methods of public health and environmental risk assessment. It then outlines three major “Science Challenges” that can serve as organizing principles for such research going forward, both in terms of bringing together existing insights from multiple disciplines to help address environmental protection needs today, as well as new research that can help fill critical research gaps, and key integrative elements that cut across these three Challenges.\nBackground: The Challenge Climate Change Poses for Environmental Protection\nOver the next few decades, climate change is expected to intensify current air and water quality issues and increase stresses on public health and environmental systems (U.S. EPA 2009, 2012; USGCRP 2016, 2018). Managing these trends will involve applying, and potentially adapting, regulatory and other environmental management mechanisms to ensure their continued effectiveness in an environment with shifting temperatures, more frequent and severe heavy rainfall events, longer and deeper droughts, larger and more widespread wildfires, rising seas, and ocean acidification (IPCC 2014a; Melillo et al. 2014; USGCRP 2017, 2018). It also will involve assessing the systemic environmental threats posed by accelerating climate change and designing and implementing actions to manage them. Characterizing both specific and system-wide risks from climate change, and supporting the development of appropriate response options, is therefore a critical charge for organizations whose mission it is to ensure environmental quality and associated public health outcomes. The unique nature of the climate change problem, however, presents significant challenges for such efforts that ultimately must be overcome if these organizations are to maintain efficient and effective policy and decision-making in the face of climate change (Morgan et al. 1999; Sussman et al. 2014). This charge, and set of challenges, is situated within a larger conversation about the value of framing climate change, as a scientific-societal issue, from within a risk perspective (Sutton 2019; Weaver et al. 2017; King et al. 2015), a conversation in which environmental protection organizations should be expected to play a leading role, given their extensive experience with environmental risk assessment and risk management.\nDeveloped over a long and successful application to critical environmental problems, risk assessment methods, practices, and tools have provided the foundation for the ability of EPA and other environmental protection organizations to leverage the best available science in meeting their missions to protect human health and the environment (Ruckelshaus 1983; NRC 1983, 1996). Combining approaches and methodologies from fields such as human exposure research, environmental toxicology, and epidemiology, the risk assessment paradigm has served as a coherent framework for the environmental protection community to identify and manage hazardous exposures in populations and ecosystems from pollutants and toxins in the environment. Nevertheless, the expected and potential impacts of climate change challenge traditional risk assessment in five fundamental ways.\nFirst, climate change calls into question the assumption of stationarity, which explicitly or implicitly underpins a wide array of risk assessment tools and methods (Milly et al. 2008). Stationarity assumes that the future is a close statistical analog of the past, and that past climatic conditions therefore provide the basis for projecting future impacts and developing corresponding policy responses. Increasingly, though, this assumption is no longer valid as weather and climate conditions move beyond the envelope of observed patterns within which all environmental regulations and management practices have been developed and implemented (USGCRP 2017). Climate change also is likely to alter causal links between processes affecting pollutant formation and transport and subsequent health and ecosystem effects (e.g., Greaver et al. 2016). Furthermore, because climate change is a global phenomenon, potentially affecting everything, everywhere, with impacts that cut across geographic region, ecosystem type, population group, or socioeconomic sector, it challenges traditional, media-specific regulatory boundaries. This inability to assume stationarity thus applies to risk assessment within and across all such media and systems.\nSecond, while great scientific advances have been made over the last few decades in climate science, this nonstationarity challenge is compounded by remaining large and often hard-to-characterize uncertainties associated with future climate change and its impacts (Lempert et al. 2004; Weaver et al. 2013). These uncertainties result from limitations on the predictability of specific consequences of climate change due to the complexity of key climate system processes and forcings, including potentially large but uncertain climate feedbacks, the uncertain trajectory of future GHG emissions, and natural, internal variability of the climate system (Hawkins and Sutton 2009). Although there is growing confidence in the long-term, global-scale consequences of climate change, limits on climate system predictability are experienced most strongly at precisely the space and time-scales most relevant for environmental management, such as the regional and local scales of watersheds and communities, or for short-term extremes such as stagnation episodes and heavy rainfall events (Dawson et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2015). What this means in practical terms is that, not only is the past no longer a reliable guide to the future, but our ability to project into the future through other means, such as model simulations, also has limits. Applying new approaches to risk assessment and management will therefore often be necessary if we wish to overcome these constraints (Weaver et al. 2013).\nThird, basing long-term environmental protection planning on “most likely” or “best-guess” future conditions is no longer fully appropriate in the context of climate change. Core principles of risk management applied across a diverse range of sectors, from insurance and finance, to aircraft and power plant safety, recommend planning approaches based on limiting the risks of catastrophic damages, not just damages resulting from marginal shifts in average conditions (Kunreuther et al. 2013; de Perez et al. 2014; Heal and Millner 2014). What is clear is that climate change will shift the distributions of key metrics like temperature and precipitation, significantly increasing both the frequency and severity of extreme meteorological conditions locally, as well as the potential for worst-case scenarios, in terms of melting ice and carbon cycle feedbacks (NRC 2013). Accounting for such shifts is critically important in assessing and managing overall climate-related risk, since the total risk from climate change is not symmetrical with respect to the distribution of future outcomes, but is instead heavily skewed toward low-probability, high-consequence futures (Hinkel et al. 2015; King et al. 2015).\nFourth, most of the risks from climate change result not from the direct toxicity of GHGs, as with other pollutants, but through the diversity of effects due to warming-induced shifts in weather patterns and baseline environmental conditions (one exception is ocean acidification). Such shifts can be direct (e.g., flooding due to heavy rainfall or sea level rise) or indirect (e.g., changes in ecosystem structure and function), each of which can affect human health and human systems (IPCC 2014a; Melillo et al. 2014). Although the proximal effect of increasing emissions is a global increase in GHG concentrations and global-mean temperature, specific impacts can be highly local, with the populations experiencing the greatest impacts in many cases not those generating the most significant GHG emissions. Furthermore, climate change impacts on a given management endpoint will be the result of complex interactions among these climatic stressors and other, nonclimatic stressors that also change over time. These interactions include the intersection between phenomena occurring over multiple space and time-scales: for example, the implications for terrestrial ecosystems of an increasing frequency of heat waves, leading to heat stress, drought, and vegetation-damaging high ozone events, combined with a longer growing season, expanding ranges of pest and invasive species, and more frequent and intense wildland fires (USGCRP 2018). Such climate-driven changes in forests and other land ecosystems also have the potential to affect water quality by reducing the natural capacity of those ecosystems to process pollutants. These multistressor interactions also include the joint impacts of changing climate and simultaneous socioeconomic trends, such as in population and demographics, land use, nutrient inputs, economic growth, technological innovation, and even adaptation responses to climate change (Bierwagen et al. 2010; Georgescu et al. 2014). Climate change is a “risk multiplier” that interacts with other stressors to create new, or alter existing, risks (DoD 2014). Many of the greatest potential risks from climate change will be a consequence of cascading (or cumulative) impacts and feedbacks among these interlinked components in ways that are hard to anticipate. This complexity confounds simple causation models, making more difficult the development of robust exposure assessments and risk characterization in support of rulemaking.\nFifth, the climate change problem challenges our ability to value the full range of impacts, quantitatively or sometimes even qualitatively (USGCRP 2011; Sussman et al. 2014). Though some recent efforts have improved our ability to quantify certain economic impacts of climate change (U.S. EPA 2015; Risky Business Project 2014; O’Neill et al. 2017), there are many other types of impacts that are more difficult to capture with the economic valuation methods used in these studies. For example, some impacts, such as loss of cultural heritage, are largely intangible, and therefore difficult to define and measure, but represent meaningful losses nevertheless. In addition, the most severe potential impacts challenge fundamental assumptions of marginality (along with other core precepts of economic analysis) and are thus difficult to capture accurately as damage functions in current large-scale economic models (Weitzman 2011; Weyant 2014). Furthermore, because of the long lag built into the climate system between emissions and the experience of the largest impacts, the consequences of both climate change, and the policy choices made today in response, will span decades to generations. The result is an unprecedented degree of long-range thinking called for in policy and planning, with close attention paid to the challenging economic problems of intergenerational equity and discounting (Heal 2009).\nThe inertia of the climate system is such that impacts may remain manageable, if increasingly severe, for the next few decades under plausible scenarios of GHG emissions—at least for the developed world (see, however, Xu et al. (2018) about the potential for global warming to accelerate over the next two decades). Beyond this time, however, if cumulative GHG concentrations continue to build in the atmosphere, rapidly increasing global temperatures are expected to drive increasingly large changes in extreme weather, sea level, and ecosystem response, with associated impacts beyond what all countries, developed and developing, may be able to readily manage (Lenton et al. 2008; NRC 2013). Avoiding the worst of these impacts, and averting potentially catastrophic tipping points in physical, biological, and socioeconomic systems, seemingly implies that within a few short decades we will need to restructure our global energy system to bring emissions of GHGs rapidly to near zero (IPCC 2014b). Such an enormous undertaking would itself be expected to profoundly affect society and the environment. Because of the inter-connectedness of natural and human systems, the environmental effects of technologies and interventions deployed to mitigate the causes of climate change would likely create challenges for environmental health and human well-being that would also need to be managed, and hence would themselves become the concern of environmental protection organizations. In other words, we soon will be faced with either transformational impacts or transformational responses—and likely a combination thereof. Both will challenge environmental protection efforts in ways that transcend any policy precedent.\nImplicit throughout the previous discussion is the need to understand linked biophysical and social processes of change, and to do so in a way that supports societal responses to this change (Hackmann et al. 2014). This means that planning and implementing climate change-related research to inform environmental protection will require integrating the full range of disciplinary perspectives and contributions from across the scientific enterprise, including the disciplines spanning the social and behavioral sciences. It is people, and their communities, institutions, and governments, who are key drivers of climate change. In addition, climate change impacts ultimately depend on social context. And climate change solutions, both in terms of reducing emissions and increasing resilience, will require greater understanding of how decisions are made by individuals and communities; the key characteristics of socio-environmental systems that lead to reduced vulnerability and enhanced resilience to climate change impacts; and the nature of sustainable environmental management under conditions of change, transition, and transformation (Dunlap and Brulle 2015). The future of climate-related research in support of environmental protection should thus explicitly recognize and incorporate the social sciences as both an important part of the integrated knowledge base for understanding the causes, consequences of, and solutions for climate change and its impacts, and a source of guiding principles that can help put this knowledge to work (Weaver et al. 2014).\nThree Science Challenges\nThese challenges of climate change as it intersects with organizational missions to protect public health and the environment, just discussed, define a space for climate-related environmental protection research efforts. As articulated, climate change poses significant near- and long-term challenges to achieving these missions, and to the traditional methods and practices by which EPA and analogous organizations conduct science-informed policy and decision-making. Drawing on a prior articulation of this research framing (see U.S. EPA 2017), while generalizing to apply more broadly across the spectrum of environmental protection organizations and efforts, these challenges, and the research portfolio needed to address them, can be organized into three distinct, high-level categories of research effort, summarized as follows:\n\n\nBroadly, these Science Challenges refer to the research needed to inform (1) adaptation actions to enhance resilience across a broad range of environmental and social stresses and continue to deliver clean air, clean water, and healthy communities and ecosystems in the face of climate change, (2) mitigation actions to limit GHG emissions and slow the underlying rate of climate change, and (3) the transition to sustainability across the full spectrum of climate change impacts and solutions. These “big bins” of climate-related research for environmental protection span media and systems, highlighting both the cross-cutting nature of climate change and the corresponding need to address its impacts across multiple policy domains simultaneously. The boundaries between these Science Challenges are fluid—and they represent a progression. For example, quantitatively assessing the range of benefits and costs of GHG policies, under Science Challenge 2, will require leveraging the full suite of media-, system-, and sector-focused climate impacts research carried out under Science Challenge 1. Similarly, research related to vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation on the one hand, and the environmental impacts of mitigation options and practices on the other, provide crucial bridges from Science Challenges 1 and 2 to the exploration of long-term, sustainable solutions under Science Challenge 3.\nTo fully support decision-makers in addressing climate change within their environmental protection missions, scientific efforts falling under these Challenges necessarily represent a balance across different modes and phases of research, including laboratory and field measurements, model development, synthesis and assessment, and development of decision support tools. It also must represent engagement and science translation around existing and newly emerging data, tools, and findings, often involving integration of key insights or data streams from across typically disparate disciplines, as well as complementary long-term, exploratory research—“horizon scanning”—in anticipation of future decision maker needs.\nIn the following subsections, we discuss the specific research topics underlying each of these three Science Challenges, highlight critical research gaps that will need to be addressed in the near term, and identify key integrative elements that point the way toward a long-term synthesis.\nScience Challenge 1\nThe large-scale, long-term changes in Earth’s climate due to increasing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere manifest themselves, locally and over shorter time-scales, as shifts in the statistics of a wide array of weather- and climate-related extremes (Herring et al. 2016; USGCRP 2017; Wobus et al. 2018; Sanderson et al. 2019). That such extremes—including heat waves, heavy rainfall events, droughts, wildfires, stagnation events, hurricanes, and winter storms—strongly influence air quality, water quality, human health, community vulnerability, and ecosystem integrity and services is well understood (USGCRP 2018), even though the pathways connecting these meteorological and climatological phenomena with ecological and human systems can be complex. In addition, increasing global temperatures caused by rising GHG concentrations drive trends in key baseline environmental conditions closely tied to environmental protection organizational missions, including increased proportions of precipitation falling as rain versus snow, lengthening of the growing season, elevated stream temperatures, sea level rise, permafrost melting, and ocean acidification (Melillo et al. 2014; U.S. EPA 2016c; USGCRP 2018). Many of these impacts can interact with each other to drive additional environmental changes, and/or have effects that cut across a range of media-specific endpoints, such as the direct and indirect role of wildfires in air quality, terrestrial ecosystems, and water quality.\nThe immediate challenge is to understand how the profound changes in driving climate conditions, both means and extremes, are now affecting, and will increasingly affect, water and air quality, ecosystems, and human health and communities, given the loss of stationarity and deep uncertainty about future changes. These insights into the diverse environmental impacts of climate change are a foundational need for improving the scientific support provided to the development and implementation of regulations, guidance, tools, and capabilities for managing these impacts as they evolve.\nSuccessfully addressing Science Challenge 1 relies, first, on integrating the existing research strengths of the public health and environmental sciences communities with the complementary research carried out within the climate science community (e.g., see Anderson et al. 2019). Research that falls under Science Challenge 1 uses scientific information on the changing statistics of climate, leveraging analysis of observed trends as well as outputs from climate model simulations, and integrates this knowledge base with observational and experimental data, modeling tools, and analytic approaches for assessing exposures, toxicity, and health outcomes. For example, to support the evaluation of climate change impacts within EPA, researchers build on core strengths in air pollution, watershed, and exposure modeling. A key task within this research portfolio is the adaptation of existing models (e.g., the Community Multiscale Air Quality model) for use in targeted assessments of vulnerabilities and emerging risks. Such model adaptation involves building capability within the models to assess climate change effects, e.g., by modifying them to receive future scenarios of key driving climate variables as inputs or by updating climate-sensitive model parameterizations. Other critical tasks include developing improved climate-related vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies; innovative decision analytic approaches and frameworks to help decision-makers manage uncertainties associated with future climate change; scenario products for use in these new approaches and frameworks; new indicators of system change to support monitoring and adaptive management under both climate change and other interacting stressors; and scientific syntheses of integrated climate change effects relevant for environmental management.\nTable 1 provides examples, situated within an EPA context but more broadly applicable, of key research topics, and associated knowledge gaps, related to Science Challenge 1, organized according to their focus on specific media and type of impacts: including water quality, air quality, health, and ecosystems and land, while acknowledging that a priority direction for future research is to focus more strongly on interactions of effects across media and systems (see the Science Challenge 3 subsection ahead).\nTable 1\nCritical climate-related research topics and knowledge gaps under Science Challenge 1, by major environmental media (adapted and synthesized from research narratives provided in U.S. EPA 2017)\nIn addition to the media- and system-specific research gaps identified in Table 1, there are several conceptual and analytical challenges that cut across all media and systems. For example, climate change is only one of several linked, local-to-global changes that will affect the environment. These include changes in population and demographics, economic growth, technology, land use, biogeochemical cycles, and environmental toxins. A critical element of climate-related research for environmental protection must be to improve understanding of how these stressors interact and coevolve with climate change to alter climate-driven impacts (e.g., Post et al. 2012; Hewitt et al. 2016; Morefield et al. 2018). Similarly, climate change will likely impact multiple environmental management endpoints simultaneously. For example, climate change is likely to alter the fate and transport of toxic chemicals in the environment and even the sensitivity of humans and other organisms to their effects (Noyes et al. 2009; Balbus et al. 2013; Hooper et al. 2013), as well as increase risks to treatment infrastructure and waste sites, with corresponding public health consequences, as illustrated recently with hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017.\nFurthermore, as already discussed, climate change calls into question the assumption of stationarity which underpins a broad range of risk assessment tools and approaches. Although challenging, this reality of the climate change problem does not preclude effective risk assessment and risk management. Much progress can be made by adapting and applying core principles of risk assessment in a climate change context (King et al. 2015; Weaver et al. 2017). These include working backward from identifying the type and magnitude of impacts that would create important risks, to then examine the scientific plausibility of climate change triggering those risks, including low-probability but high-consequence outcomes (Brown et al. 2011; Kunreuther et al. 2013). This perspective aligns with emerging thinking in other areas of concern in environmental protection, such as chemical risk assessment (e.g., see Gwinn et al. 2017). While this type of approach can help clarify the extent and timing of needed response actions, it will also create new demands on the kind of information needed from the climate science community—for example from climate models—potentially opening up new research avenues as well (Weaver et al. 2013).\nFinally, as introduced earlier in the paper, a greater role for knowledge and expertise from a broad range of social sciences disciplines in research related to climate impacts on public health and environmental management endpoints has been recommended by multiple review bodies (e.g., BOSC 2016). In response, some environmental protection organizations, including EPA, have been increasing their efforts to integrate social sciences into their research programs in response (U.S. EPA 2016a; Costa and Hubbell 2016). For example, one major priority for this interdisciplinary integration under Science Challenge 1 should be to improve understanding of the disproportionate impacts of climate change on environmental justice communities, including Tribal communities and communities of color, that exacerbate existing disparities (e.g., Harlan et al. 2015; Maldonado et al. 2013; USGCRP, 2016; Mikati et al. 2018; USGCRP 2018).\nScience Challenge 2\nThe basic need under Science Challenge 2 is for research to both inform the development, implementation, and assessment of actions, regulatory and otherwise, that effectively control emissions of GHGs and short-lived climate forcers over the long term, and improve understanding of the potential for both co-benefits and adverse impacts of these actions (Anenberg et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2014; Miller and Gage 2011; Poto_nik and Khosla 2016; Shindell et al. 2016; West et al. 2013). Research to date related to Science Challenge 2 has mainly fallen within the following categories: (1) emissions measurements and projections; (2) benefits assessment across multiple GHG emissions scenarios; and (3) analysis of the mutual co-benefits of air quality and GHG regulatory actions and transitions to alternative energy technologies. As with Science Challenge 1 and Table 1, Table 2 summarizes key research topics, and associated knowledge gaps, related to Science Challenge 2.\nTable 2\nCritical climate-related research topics and knowledge gaps under Science Challenge 2 (adapted and synthesized from research narratives provided in U.S. EPA 2017)\nOne major, cross-cutting research need is to improve understanding of how the environmental impacts of GHG emissions reduction strategies can become increasingly important as the scale of implementation grows. For instance, biofuels and natural gas have long been seen as important components of a long-term GHG mitigation strategy (Pacala and Socolow 2004; Winchester and Reilly 2015). As the production of these fuels has grown, however, environmental protection organizations have had to respond to environmental concerns over both these approaches, including changes in land use and nutrient runoff, and potential impacts on groundwater and air quality (U.S. EPA 2011; U.S. EPA 2016b; U.S. EPA 2018; Colburn et al. 2011; Vidic et al. 2013). More broadly, understanding the environmental consequences of GHG emissions reduction approaches, and developing methods to avoid adverse impacts, is critical to developing environmentally sustainable responses to climate change.\nIn addition, understanding the costs of mitigation must be accompanied by understanding the benefits (and co-benefits) of mitigation actions. To support such comparisons, damage functions in economic and integrated assessment models need improvement (Weyant 2014; NASEM 2016). Development of effective damage functions involves considerably more than estimating dollars per unit impact; informa","{'tone': 'Frustrated', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'summary': ""The comments express frustration with the U.S. government's budget cuts to the EPA, which are seen as negatively impacting the environment and affecting the entire world, not just the U.S.""}","['Here is a frustrated reddit reply (under 100 words) addressing the comments summarized in the prompt and including content from the provided article:\n\nUgh, another example of the U.S. government failing to take climate change seriously!

“People vs. Fossil Fuels”: Over 530 Arrested in Historic Indigenous-Led Climate Protests in D.C.
This week over 530 climate activists were arrested during Indigenous-led civil disobedience actions in Washington, D.C., calling on President Joe Biden to declare a climate emergency and stop approving fossil fuel projects. Indigenous leaders have issued a series of demands, including the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose offices they occupied on Thursday for the first time since the 1970s. The protests come just weeks before the start of the critical U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, which President Biden and senior Cabinet members are expected to attend. “We’re not going anywhere,” says Siqiñiq Maupin, with Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, who traveled from Alaska to D.C. and was among those arrested during the BIA occupation. “We do not have time for negotiations, for compromises. We need to take this serious and take action now.” We also speak with Joye Braun, with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Indigenous Environmental Network, who was deeply involved in the Standing Rock protests to stop the Dakota Access pipeline. “The United States government brought the frontlines to us, to the Indigenous people, to our doorsteps,” says Braun. “And we wanted to bring the frontlines to his doorstep to let him see that we are very serious about climate change and declaring a climate emergency.”
AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
We begin today’s show in Washington, D.C., where over 530 climate activists have been arrested in a historic week of civil disobedience calling on President Biden to declare a climate emergency and stop approving fossil fuel projects. The Indigenous-led protests have been part of a mobilization dubbed “People vs. Fossil Fuels.” On Thursday, Indigenous activists occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs for the first time since the 1970s. Indigenous leaders issued a series of demands, including the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, restoration of 110 million acres of land taken away from Native nations, the return of Indigenous children buried at residential schools, and no new leases for oil and gas or extractive industries on public lands. Fifty-five people involved in the takeover were arrested. Indigenous activists have also been leading daily acts of civil disobedience outside the White House. This is a member of the Red Lakes in Minnesota speaking Monday.
RED LAKE ACTIVIST: We are the voice of the animals, we are the voice of the trees, because they don’t have the voice. Creator, to us, gave us stewardship over the land, so that’s what we are doing. We are fighting for clean water for future generations, for Mother Earth, for the world.
AMY GOODMAN: Indigenous youth activists are scheduled to lead a march to the U.S. Capitol today. This week’s protests in D.C. come just weeks before the start of the critical U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. CNN is reporting President Biden is planning to attend along with 13 Cabinet members in the first week. But U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is already admitting the talks will likely fail to reach a global target on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. During a protest outside the White House Monday, Joye Braun of the Indigenous Environmental Network called on President Biden to uphold promises made to Indigenous communities.
JOYE BRAUN: You need to be held accountable. You made promises to the Indigenous communities across this land that you were going to uphold. But you haven’t upheld those promises. You’ve been speaking with a forked tongue, just like that one that was before you.
AMY GOODMAN: That was Joye Braun speaking Monday outside the White House. She’s joining us now in Washington. She’s a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a frontline community organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. She was deeply involved in the Standing Rock protests to stop the Dakota Access pipeline.
And we’re joined by Siqiñiq Maupin, the executive director of Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic. She lives in Fairbanks, Alaska. She was arrested yesterday during the occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and that’s where we’re going to begin.
Siqiñiq, can you talk about this protest? We didn’t know if we’d have you on the show today because we didn’t know if you were going to be getting out of jail, but we got word last night that you were.
SIQIÑIQ MAUPIN: Yes. We had gathered to let Biden know that we’re not going anywhere. Signing petitions and giving them and following these laws have not gotten us where we need to be. There is a climate emergency. People are dying right now. And we needed to make a statement. And I think that we did.
AMY GOODMAN: So, talk about what you’re demanding of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
SIQIÑIQ MAUPIN: The BIA was created to erase Indigenous people. It has always been against us. And today, or yesterday, and every day, we demand that it be abolished. We do not need a blood quantum to say how Indigenous we are or to qualify that. We know our Indigenous ways to protect this land, this Earth, this water. And we understand that the Earth is unbalanced. And we do not have time for negotiations, for compromises. We need to take this serious and take action now.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about what happened in August, when your group, along with others, were able to get the U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason to throw out the approvals of a major oil project in your state of Alaska?
SIQIÑIQ MAUPIN: Yes. That was a extraordinary time, considering, during the heart of the pandemic in 2020, the Bureau of Land Management decided to hold the hearings for opening the Willow Master Project, located outside of Nuiqsut, where my mother lives and my family is from. And we heard testimony from tribal administrators, corporation presidents, Native corporation presidents, begging the Bureau of Land Management to stop these hearings until the pandemic was over, until we got it under control. And they, quite literally, did not listen. You can just hear sobbing, and they continued on. They made the record of decision. And it felt a little hopeless, especially with Biden’s approval of this project even though he promised he was going to take the climate crisis serious. So, having the 9th Circuit overthrow this was such a big win, especially when the corruption is so rampant within our government.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about specifically your action yesterday? I think it was reported some 55 water protectors were arrested and taken from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. And to talk about how significant this is, the last time it was occupied was by Native Americans in the 1970s. On November 3rd, 1972, a group of 500 American Indians with the American Indian Movement took over the Interior building, the culmination of a cross-country journey that was called the Trail of Broken Treaties, intended to bring attention to Native American issues, such as living standards and treaty rights. Why did you focus on the BIA? Are you calling for it to be disbanded?
SIQIÑIQ MAUPIN: Yes. And we wanted to make a statement that we are still here. We have been fighting against the genocide of our people, colonization, since contact. And we are not going away. We came with matriarchs that led us, and that was, I think, a powerful statement to have our women come in front again and to lead us into that building. I followed their guidance. And we were able to, again, make a statement at the BIA, an organization created to, quite literally, erase us from this place, this Earth, with blood quantum. We do demand the abolishment of BIA and to also say that Indigenous people have always been the caretakers of this land, and we will continue to be the caretakers.
AMY GOODMAN: I want to bring Joye Braun into this conversation, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, frontline community organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network, which organized this week of historic protest. I dare say, with President Biden now saying he and 13 members of his Cabinet are going to go to the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, may well be a result of what you all have done this week right outside the White House. We last talked to you, Joye, at the standoff at Standing Rock. Can you talk about the organizing of this week, what’s happened and what you want to see come out of it? You, along with over 500 people, like Siqiñiq, have been arrested.
JOYE BRAUN: Hi. It’s good to be on the show again and to see you today.
Well, I certainly hope that President Biden is listening. You know, the United States government brought the frontlines to us, to the Indigenous people, to our doorsteps, and we wanted to bring the frontlines to his doorstep, to let him see that we are very serious about climate change and declaring a climate emergency.
People vs. Fossil Fuels came out of Build Back Fossil Free, a coalition of over 200 frontline organizations around the United States that came together and said, “We’re not being heard. We’re not being listened to. And we have to unite. We need to unite together to let this administration know that we are serious, and, you know, we’re tired.”
We go to all the hearings. We do the petitions. We make the phone calls. And it’s not working. They’re still allowing pipelines to go through illegally. Dakota Access pipeline is still an illegal pipeline. And, of course, they did not do a full EIS on Line 3, and they’re ignoring treaty rights on Line 5 and Mountain Valley pipeline.
AMY GOODMAN: Joye, these protests are historic. You knew people who, back in the 1970s, were part of that AIM takeover, the American Indian Movement takeover, of the Bureau of Indian Affairs?
JOYE BRAUN: I was a little kid back in the 1970s, so that I was, like, maybe like 3 years old. So I was just a toddler at that time. But we definitely heard about those times. And we did have elders with us this week who were part of that particular movement in the ’70s.
What happened this time, again, was organic. There was no leadership. It was just the people saying that we need to go and make a statement that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has — you know, it only was designed to eliminate us, like my new daughter — because we like to adopt children — like my new daughter Siqiñiq has said. We need to erase blood quantum. What other people in the world must still carry a card saying what percentage of blood you are, like a horse or a dog? I mean, that’s crazy.
So, plus, you know, the DOI did give 2,500 new oil and gas leases on BLM property, when President Biden said, “Oh, we’re going to stop all new leases,” but then opens it back up and then also threatens the Arctic with new leases, and the Gulf Coast, of course, with new leases and new LNG projects.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you describe some of the other actions, Joye, that have been taking place in Washington? For example, the Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House was — the words “expect us” were written across it. What did that mean?
JOYE BRAUN: Well, it came out of “Respect us or expect us.” And that is a saying that was said, geez, many, many times over the years during the fight, from the 1970s and ’80s, in the ’90s. It was something that one of my mentors, Deb White Plume, used to say. And, of course, I said it at Standing Rock when we were at Treaty Camp. But I woke up, like many people, and saw the redecoration of that statue. Jackson was the one that caused mass genocide to Indigenous people. I mean, tens of thousands of Indigenous people died at his hands, and, of course, started the Trail of Tears, for many tribes, including the Cherokee.
AMY GOODMAN: Earlier this week, protesters climbed a flagpole outside the Army Corps of Engineers office demanding a stop to the Line 3 crude oil pipeline?
JOYE BRAUN: Yes, yes. I was there. Two flagpoles were climbed by Indigenous activists. And the flags were — those became coup presents. We kind of grabbed and nabbed them. But, you know, that’s kind of something that we would have done if we were in battle. We like to go grab the enemy’s flag. So that’s what happened.
AMY GOODMAN: Yet, at the same time, you have the first Indigenous, the first Native American cabinet member to be named, under — and this was under President Biden, Deb Haaland, who is a former congressmember from New Mexico. She is the interior secretary. Now, according to AP, she was not in the Interior Department’s building, where the BIA is, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, on Thursday. But can you talk about her role and if you’ve had conversations with her?
JOYE BRAUN: Well, of course, different organizations have been trying to reach out to who we call Auntie Deb. We love Auntie Deb. Make no doubt about it. We love Auntie Deb. We love that she was appointed by President Biden. We love that she’s been able to get some really good, positive work done. However, her hands have been tied by the Biden administration when it comes to climate change. Like I said, the DOI allowed 2,500 new oil and gas leases, when President Biden could have said, “We’re going to stop them, and we’re not going to allow this to happen.”
In order for us to truly make a climate change in the world, in order for us to say, “Hey, we are leaders in climate,” then we must stop all new oil and gas infrastructure, especially on public lands. And unfortunately, Auntie Deb hasn’t been able to do those types of things because her hands are tied by the Biden administration’s policies.
So, we love Auntie Deb. She’s doing an amazing job. We’re really, really proud of her. But President Biden needs to be held accountable for not following through.
AMY GOODMAN: Siqiñiq Maupin, we’re giving you the last word. You came down from Alaska, a leading Indigenous rights activist at your young age. What do you take away from this week?
SIQIÑIQ MAUPIN: I take away knowing that this is not an isolated incident in Alaska, where children are getting cancer, asthma. We are seeing our caribou with black bone marrow, with mold on our fish. And we come to our relatives, and the same things are happening in communities all over the world. And we are saying enough is enough, and standing with leadership with no leader but an entire group of an Indigenous peoples and allies that are saying, “Expect us,” because we have not been respected.
AMY GOODMAN: We thank you both for being with us. Siqiñiq Maupin is the executive director of the Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, and Joye Braun, member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, a frontline community organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, which has organized this historic civil disobedience in Washington that have lasted throughout the week. At this point, over 530 people have been arrested.
Coming up, we look at the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the world’s largest jail complex, right here in New York City, Rikers Island. Stay with us.

FEATURED U.S. CASES
Federal Courts Said Airline Deregulation Act Preempted Climate Washing Claims Against Airlines
In August 2024, two federal district courts ruled that the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA) preempted consumers’ state law claims that airlines misled consumers regarding their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On August 26, the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia held that the Airline Deregulation Act expressly preempted climate washing claims against the operator of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM). The ADA’s preemption clause provides that states “may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier.” The plaintiff asserted a claim under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) and a breach of contract claim based on allegations that KLM misled consumers with its “Fly Responsibly” initiative, which committed the airline to greenhouse gas emissions reductions consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement. (The plaintiff originally also brought an unjust enrichment claim but later withdrew it.) The plaintiff alleged that no credible evidence supported the claim that purchase of carbon credits, including for reforestation projects, would negate the effects of flying. The plaintiff also alleged that KLM’s limited use of sustainable aviation fuels would have a negligible impact on emissions. The court found that the VCPA claim was preempted because it relied upon enforcement of state law and because the plaintiff’s argument that KLM’s climate change-related marketing was misleading “certainly relates” to KLM’s service. The court also found that the ADA preempted the breach of contract claim. The court first noted that “the contours of the alleged contract are unclear” and also rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant’s climate-related advertising should be incorporated into the terms of the contract. The court found, however, that the “larger issue” was that the breach of contract claim did not fit within an exception to ADA preemption for breach of contract claims alleging a defendant’s “breach of its own, self-imposed undertaking,” without “enlargement or enhancement based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.” The court found that the plaintiff’s breach of contract claim was a “thinly veiled repackaging of his VCPA claim” (i.e., based on state laws or policies) and that the preemption exception therefore did not apply. Long v. Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, N.V., No. 3:23-cv-00435 (E.D. Va. Aug. 26, 2024)
On August 13, the federal district court for the District of Maryland held that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted a plaintiff’s climate washing claims against United Airlines, Inc. (United). The plaintiff asserted a claim under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act and a common law fraud claim (later withdrawn), alleging that he paid more to fly on United because the company was committed to reducing the impacts of flying, including by using sustainable aviation fuel. He alleged he would not have paid more had he known that only .025% of United’s fuel supply was SAF and that SAF still emits carbon dioxide and other pollutants. The court “easily” concluded that the MCPA claim related to United’s provision of transportation services and was therefore preempted by the ADA. The court further concluded that the claim should be dismissed with prejudice because “the deceptive provision of services is the heart of the claim,” and the plaintiff would not be able to amend the claim to escape dismissal.

DECISIONS AND SETTLEMENTS
Tenth Circuit Vacated 2020 District Court Decision Holding that 2016 Waste Prevention Rule Exceeded BLM’s Authority; Petition for Rehearing Filed
After the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) adopted a final rule in April 2024 that aimed to reduce waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian leases, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a district court’s 2020 ruling and judgment that vacated portions of the Obama administration’s 2016 rule that also aimed to reduce waste of natural gas. The district court held that the 2016 rule exceeded BLM’s authority under the Mineral Leasing Act and that BLM acted arbitrarily and capriciously in adopting the rule. The Tenth Circuit noted that all appellate parties agreed that the appeal from the district court’s 2020 ruling and judgment should be dismissed as moot. The Tenth Circuit further concluded, however, that it was appropriate to follow the general rule of vacating the district court’s ruling when a case becomes moot during appeal. Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, Montana, Western Energy Alliance, and Independent Petroleum Association of America (Petitioners) had argued that the district court’s ruling should be left in place because some of the appellants were responsible for delaying the appeal until the regulation 2016 regulation was replaced, but the Tenth Circuit was not persuaded. The Tenth Circuit noted that practitioners and courts could continue to consult the district court’s 2020 ruling “for its potential value as persuasive authority.” Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, and Texas have filed a separate lawsuit in the District of North Dakota challenging the 2024 rule. On August 27, the Petitioners asked the Tenth Circuit for panel rehearing requesting either that the court not vacate the district court’s judgment or clarify that BLM may not retroactively enforce the 2016 rule. Wyoming v. U.S. Department of the Interior, No. 20-8072 (10th Cir. Aug. 13, 2024)
D.C. Circuit Vacated FERC Reauthorization of Texas LNG Terminals and Gas Pipeline but Rejected Challenges to Analysis of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC’s) reauthorization of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in Cameron County, Texas, and a pipeline to carry gas to one of the terminals. FERC reauthorized the projects on remand from an earlier D.C. Circuit decision that found that FERC failed to adequately analyze climate change and environmental justice impacts. In considering FERC’s reauthorization, the D.C. Circuit found that FERC erred by declining to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement to address its “entirely new and significantly expanded environmental justice analysis that reached new conclusions” and by failing to consider a proposed carbon capture and sequestration system for one of the terminals as part of its supplemental environmental review. The D.C. Circuit also found that FERC should have explained why it declined to consider air quality data from an air monitor that was closer to the projects than the monitor from which the project applicant’s analysis drew its data. The D.C. Circuit rejected challenges to FERC’s updated ozone and greenhouse gas analyses. The D.C. Circuit found that FERC had adequately responded to the court’s earlier decision by explaining why a Council on Environmental Quality National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation did not compel use of the social cost of carbon protocol to assess the significance of greenhouse gas emissions. Because it concluded that FERC had adequately explained why the NEPA regulation did not alter the greenhouse gas analysis, the D.C. Circuit also rejected the petitioners’ related argument that FERC did not explain greenhouse gas emissions’ role in its public interest determinations under the Natural Gas Act. In addition, the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider arguments that the petitioners did not make before FERC regarding whether other regulations required FERC to somehow evaluate the significance of greenhouse gas emissions. City of Port Isabel v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Nos. 23-1174, 23-1221 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 6, 2024)
New York Federal Court Dismissed Some Defendants from Challenge to State’s Natural Gas Ban
In a challenge to New York’s ban on natural gas appliances and infrastructure in certain new construction, the federal district court for the Northern District of New York dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds claims against the New York Department of State, the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council (Code Council), and individual members of the Code Council. The plaintiffs conceded that claims against the Department of State and the Code Council were barred by sovereign immunity but argued unsuccessfully that claims were not barred against individual Code Council members because the members were tasked with implementing the statutory ban by amending the Energy and Building Codes and were thus enforcing state law under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young. The court found that suing the individual members in their official capacity “is little more than an attempt to sue the State under a different name, because those members … do not have a sufficient connection to the enforcement of the relevant statute.” The court noted that although the statute directs the Code Council to incorporate the ban into the Codes, the law specifies that the Secretary of State and county or local governments will have enforcement authorities. The court also noted, moreover, that the Secretary, not the Code Council members, had final authority to review and approve the amendments. The court granted the plaintiffs’ request for dismissal without prejudice in light of “significant uncertainty” regarding whether dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds is jurisdictional (and thus necessarily without prejudice) or an affirmative defense. The court stated, however, that the plaintiffs would not be permitted to amend their complaint against the dismissed defendants. The court declined to limit relief sought against the Secretary of State to prospective relief at this juncture, given that there was no indication the plaintiffs were seeking relief beyond that scope.

New Mexico Federal Court Said Review of Magnesium Processing Mill’s Impacts on Air Quality Emissions Was Sufficient
The federal district court for the District of New Mexico remanded a case challenging the approval of a magnesium ore mining project to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for additional consideration of water quality impacts but found that BLM otherwise complied with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Land Policy Management Act. The court found that BLM took the required “hard look” at reasonably foreseeable air quality impacts of an off-site processing mill, including impacts on emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and sulfur hexafluoride. Friends of the Floridas v. U.S. Bureau of Land Management, No. 2:20-cv-00924 (D.N.M. Aug. 27, 2024)
Trial Set for December 2024 in Endangered Species Act Challenge to Montana’s Wolf and Coyote Trapping and Snaring Regulations
The federal district court for the District of Montana denied motions for summary judgment in advance of a December 2024 bench trial in conservation groups’ lawsuit asserting that Montana’s authorization of wolf and coyote trapping and snaring in grizzly bear habitat would result in unlawful take of grizzly bears under the Endangered Species Act, due in part to increased wintertime grizzly bear activity. Regarding the plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment, the court found that there were unresolved factual issues regarding whether future grizzly bear takings by wolf and coyote traps were reasonably certain. The court also found that questions regarding whether coyote traps and snares threaten grizzly bears prevented partial summary judgment for agricultural groups that intervened as defendants. The court also rejected the defendants’ challenges to the plaintiffs’ notice of intent to sue and granted in part motions to compel expert disclosures. The court noted that the bench trial was scheduled to start on December 2, 2024. Flathead-Lolo-Bitterroot Citizen Task Force v. Montana, No. 9:23-cv-00101 (D. Mont. Aug. 28, 2024)
California Federal Court Said Environmental Reviews for Post-Wildfire Tree Removal Projects Were Adequate 
The federal district court for the Northern District of California rejected challenges to the U.S. Forest Service’s environmental review of projects to remove dead and dying trees in nine National Forests in California after wildfires in 2020 and 2021. The court found that the record showed that the Forest Service considered a reasonable range of alternatives, took a hard look at potential environmental impacts, and reasonably determined that the project would not have a significant environmental impact. The plaintiffs had alleged that the Forest Service failed to properly analyze and disclose the project’s impacts on climate change and carbon storage, but the court’s decision did not address these issues. Klamath Forest Alliance v. U.S. Forest Service, No. 3:23-cv-03601 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 23, 2024)
Oregon Federal Court Rejected Challenge to Plaintiffs’ Standing in Lawsuit Regarding Air Force’s Plan to Expand Aircraft Training
The federal district court for the District of Oregon adopted a magistrate judge’s findings and recommendation and denied the U.S. Department of the Air Force’s motion to dismiss conservation groups’ lawsuit challenging the expansion of military aircraft trainings over the Owyhee Canyonlands of Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada. The groups’ allegations included that the Air Force failed to take a hard look at adverse impacts, including how climate change would exacerbate impacts on resources. The magistrate judge found that the plaintiff organizations’ allegations were sufficient to establish associational standing even though the complaint did not specifically identify individual members whose interests would be impaired. Oregon Natural Desert Association v. U.S. Department of the Air Force, No. 2:24-cv-00145 (D. Or. Aug. 23, 2024)
Federal Court Said Coal Mine Owner’s Action to Compel Accelerated EIS Schedule Was Prudentially Unripe
The federal district court for the District of Columbia granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the owner and operator of an underground coal mine in Montana alleging that federal defendants violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by setting a schedule for completing an environmental impact statement (EIS) for expansion of the mine after expiration of NEPA’s statutory deadlines. NEPA, as amended in 2023, requires that an EIS be completed two years after certain trigger dates. In this case, the plaintiff contended that the trigger date was December 2, 2022, when the federal defendants represented that an EIS would be required after the Ninth Circuit found that the defendants violated NEPA, including by failing to provide an explanation for the conclusion that the mine expansion’s greenhouse gas emissions would not be significant. In February 2024, the defendants issued a schedule that projected completion of the EIS in May 2026. The district court found that the coal mine owner-operator had organizational standing because it alleged a sufficient procedural injury, as well as “necessary drain on its resources,” that were traceable to the defendants’ actions and redressable by judicial action. The court further found, however, that the case was prudentially unripe because the defendants had not yet missed the alleged deadline and the owner-operator was not likely to suffer further hardship from deferred judicial review. The court also denied conservation groups’ motion to intervene. Signal Peak Energy, LLC v. Haaland, No. 1:24-cv-00366 (D.D.C. Aug. 21, 2024)
Federal Court Vacated Biological Opinion for Gulf of Mexico Oil and Gas Development
The federal district court for the District of Maryland ruled that the 2020 biological opinion (BiOp) for oil and gas extraction in the Gulf of Mexico violated the Endangered Species Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. The court vacated the BiOp effective December 20, 2024 and remanded to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). This case had been stayed in August 2023 pursuant to an agreement pursuant to which the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management would implement measures to protect the Rice’s whale during a reinitiated consultation process. After oil and gas industry intervenor-defendants and the State of Louisiana successfully challenged the inclusion of two of the measures in Lease Sale 261 in the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana, the stay was lifted in January 2024. The court’s decision vacating the BiOp found that the BiOp underestimated the risk and harms of oil spills to protected species; that the jeopardy analysis improperly assumed that the Rice’s whale and Gulf sturgeon populations remained as large as they were before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; that the “reasonably prudent alternative” addressed only two stressors likely to jeopardize the Rice’s whale; and that the incidental take statement failed to recognize oil spill take as incidental take and did not rationally quantify the number of listed species taken by vessel strikes. The court said it was not necessary to reach certain arguments made by the plaintiffs, including two climate change-related arguments: (1) that historical spill data used by NMFS did not account for increased risk of a catastrophic spill due to factors that included climate change and (2) that NMFS failed to properly account for climate change in its jeopardy analyses. Sierra Club v. National Marine Fisheries Service, No. 20-cv-3060 (D. Md. Aug. 19, 2024)
Pennsylvania Federal Court Declined to Dismiss Climate Change Event Organizers’ First Amendment Claims Against City of Harrisburg
The federal district court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denied the City of Harrisburg and the Harrisburg mayor’s motion to dismiss First Amendment claims brought by the organizers of an annual event to raise awareness about climate change. The court found that the plaintiffs’ allegations, taken as true, adequately stated claims that the City’s requirements for use of a City park, the fees allegedly charged for use of City streets and sidewalks, and the permitting scheme for banners on City-owned utility poles violated the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. Better Path Coalition Planning Group v. City of Harrisburg, No. 1:22-cv-00623 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 19, 2024)
Challenge to Berkeley Natural Gas Ban Dismissed After Repeal of Law
On August 12, 2024, California Restaurant Association (CRA) and the City of Berkeley filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal without prejudice of CRA’s lawsuit challenging the City’s ban on natural gas infrastructure in new construction. The parties’ stipulation stated that they had “resolved this case in its entirety.” After the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Energy Policy and Conservation Act preempted the Berkeley ordinance, the City repealed the law in May 2024. California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley, No. 3:19-cv-07668 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2024)
Fish and Wildlife Service Proposed to List Climate Change-Threatened Cedar Key Mole Skink as Endangered After Settlement in Challenge to 2018 Decision Not to List
After reaching an agreement with Center for Biological Diversity in 2022 to resolve a lawsuit challenging the 2018 determination that listing of the Cedar Key mole skink under the Endangered Species Act was not warranted, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) on August 8, 2024 published a proposal to list the species as endangered and to designate 2,713 acres of critical habitat in Levy County, Cedar Keys, Florida. FWS determined that the Cedar Key mole skink was endangered due to threats associated with climate change, specifically sea level rise, increased high tide flooding, and increased intensity of storm events. Center for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, No. 2:22-cv-14038 (S.D. Fla.)
Montana Federal Court Vacated Decision Not to List Upper Missouri River Arctic Grayling Under Endangered Species Act but Found that Climate Change Was Adequately Considered
In a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS’s) 2020 finding that listing of the upper Missouri River distinct population segment of Arctic grayling was not warranted, the federal district court for the District of Montana agreed with the plaintiffs regarding two aspects of FWS’s analysis but rejected other arguments, including an argument that FWS “irrationally and unlawfully dismissed climate-change threats.” FWS made the 2020 finding on remand from a 2018 Ninth Circuit decision finding that a 2014 finding that listing was not warranted included four errors. One error involved FWS’s reliance on cold water refugia that information showed would experience low stream flows and high water temperatures. Another error identified by the Ninth Circuit was a failure to adequately explain why uncertainty created by climate change did not weigh in favor of listing. In evaluating FWS’s 2020 finding, the district court found that FWS did not act arbitrarily or capriciously or contrary to law when it addressed higher water temperatures and low stream flows, the grayling’s ability to access thermal refugia, and thermal threats to the Ruby River grayling population. The court also found that the defendants adequately considered the cumulative effects of climate change, noting that FWS supplemented its earlier climate change analysis with new studies that provided information about interactions between climate change and other potential stressors. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that FWS’s reliance on benefits of a candidate conservation agreement with assurances between FWS and non-federal property owners without considering that it might cease to exist was arbitrary and capricious. The court also found that the determination that the Ruby River grayling population was viable and would provide redundancy was arbitrary and capricious. Center for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, No. 2:23-cv-00002 (D. Mont. Aug. 6, 2024)
Federal Court Dismissed Pro Se Plaintiff’s Lawsuit Alleging that Universities Failed to Adequately Educate Students About Climate Change
The federal district court for the Southern District of New York dismissed a lawsuit brought by a pro se plaintiff against four universities in New York and New Jersey, seeking to block them from “teaching their students, and thereby the public, that the future … will be one where climate change is manageable, and sustainability is achievable.” The court found that the plaintiff did not allege a concrete and particularized injury, only “generalized grievances.” The plaintiff therefore lacked standing. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to state any claim under the National Environmental Policy Act. Anderson v. State University of New York (SUNY), No. 1:24CV02083 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2024)
Oregon Federal Court Dismissed Claims Challenging Portland Restrictions on Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminals
The federal district court for the District of Oregon found that at least one plaintiff had standing to challenge City of Portland land use restrictions on new or expanded bulk fossil fuel terminals but granted the City’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court agreed with a magistrate judge’s recommendation that the plaintiffs’ allegations were not sufficient to state a dormant Commerce Clause or Foreign Commerce Clause claim, that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for preemption under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, and that they failed to allege a substantive due process claim. The district court declined to adopt two aspects of the magistrate judge’s dormant Commerce Clause analysis. Montana v. City of Portland, No. 3:23-cv-00219 (D. Or. July 5, 2024)
Federal Court Rejected Challenge to Forest Management Project
The federal district court for the District of Oregon found that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) complied with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Land Policy Management Act when it approved the Big Weekly Elk Forest Management Project and associated timber sales. The court’s decision did not address the complaint’s allegations that BLM failed to take a hard look at the project’s impacts on carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs appealed. Cascadia Wildlands v. U.S. Bureau of Land Management, No. 6:23-cv-01358 (D. Or. June 28, 2024)
Louisiana Federal Court Found that Incarcerated Persons Were Entitled to Preliminary Injunctive Relief in Eighth Amendment Challenge to Heat Conditions on Angola Farm Line; Fifth Circuit Stayed Portions of Relief
The federal district court for the Middle District of Louisiana granted in part an application by incarcerated persons who labor on the “Farm Line” at the Angola penitentiary in Louisiana for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order enjoining agricultural labor on the Farm Line when heat index values exceed 88°F. The court found that the evidence at this stage showed that Angola’s heat-related policies were inadequate to mitigate risks of heat-related disorders, resulting in a substantial risk of serious harm. The court said the “worsening climate situation” in Louisiana and Angola compounded the inadequacies of the policies. The court further found that plaintiffs had shown a substantial likelihood of establishing that the defendants had been deliberately indifferent to these risks in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court also found that the plaintiffs showed an immediate risk of irreparable injury and that the balance of interests favored an injunction. Citing the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) provision limiting relief in prison conditions lawsuits to remedies that reduce risk to “a socially acceptable level,” the court did not entirely enjoin operation of the Farm Line when the 88°F threshold was reached but instead ordered the defendants to “take immediate measures to correct the glaring deficiencies in their heat-related policies.” The court listed five sets of actions that the defendants were required take and required them to submit a memorandum regarding proposed remedies. The defendants appealed, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed three of the five required sets of actions, but not portions of the ruling that pertained to addressing deficiencies in the defendants’ policies regarding shade, rest, and provision of adequate protective gear. The Fifth Circuit found that the three stayed portions of the district court’s ruling reached beyond persons working on the Farm Line and that the relief was therefore overbroad under the PLRA. The Fifth Circuit also found that evidence did not demonstrate the defendants’ deliberate indifference with respect to the stayed portions of the district court’s order. On August 15, 2024, the district court issued a ruling and order finding that the defendants’ remedies in response to its order had been inadequate and directing them to take additional steps, including providing additional tents to provide shade and making changes to the break schedule. Voice of the Experienced v. LeBlanc, No. 3:23-cv-01304 (M.D. La. July 2, 2024 and Aug. 15, 2024), No. 24-30420 (5th Cir. July 5, 2024)
Illinois Federal Court Found that Crypto Hedge Fund Operators Defrauded Investors with Carbon Offset Bond Product
The federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois found that defendants who operated “crypto hedge funds” whose investment products included “carbon offset bonds” (COBs) committed civil violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which brought the suit, described the COBs as promissory notes advertised as offering a collateral (Base Carbon Tons tokens) as security. The court found that the defendants defrauded investors by making material misrepresentations of fact. With respect to the COBs, the court found, for instance, that the defendants failed to inform COB purchasers that the same digital wallet holding the collateral was pledged as collateral to dozens of purchasers. The court also found that the CFTC established that the defendants misappropriated funds through the carbon offset program in a “classic Ponzi scheme” in which the defendants bought out investors in a collapsed fund at a pre-crash price, leaving the defendants with insufficient funds to pay COB participants what they were owed. The court also found that the defendants failed to register as a commodity pool operator (CPO) and committed CPO fraud. The court ordered restitution in the amount of customer losses (more than $85 million) and ordered disgorgement of collected commissions (almost $37 million). Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Ikkurty, No. 1:22-cv-02465 (N.D. Ill. July 1, 2024)
D.C. Court of Appeals Reinstated Greenwashing Suit Against Coca-Cola
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of a deceptive marketing lawsuit against Coca-Cola Company under the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA). The plaintiff, Earth Island Institute, alleged that Coca-Cola misled consumers regarding its environmental sustainability with statements that touted the company’s efforts to address packaging waste when the company actually was failing to take necessary steps to meet its sustainability goals. Allegedly misleading statements included that the company was taking a “leadership position” on the “interconnected global challenges of packaging waste and climate change.” As a threshold matter, the court found that Earth Island Institute had standing to bring the CPPA claim. On the merits, the Court of Appeals found that the plaintiff stated a facially plausible misrepresentation and rejected arguments that “aspirational” statements could not be actionable under the CPPA. The Court of Appeals also found that Coca-Cola’s claims regarding plastic packaging were “very much statements about its ‘goods and services’” for purposes of the CPPA. The appellate court also held that misleading misrepresentations did not have to be in a single statement to be actionable under the CPPA. In addition, the court rejected Coca-Cola’s argument that the First Amendment precluded the lawsuit. Earth Island Institute v. Coca-Cola Co., No. 22-CV-0895 (D.C. Aug. 29, 2024)
Maine High Court Upheld Utility Cost Allocation for Costs to Implement Climate Change-Related Policies
The Maine Supreme Judicial Court upheld a Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) order regarding the allocation to ratepayers of utilities’ costs related to power supply obligations and State energy programs, including “net energy billing” (NEB), a renewable energy incentive program. The PUC determined costs should be allocated to each class (residential, commercial, industrial) according to the class’s overall load share and that NEB costs should be recovered within each rate class through a fixed customer charge that did not change based on power usage. The PUC concluded that a fixed customer charge for NEB cost recovery was appropriate because everyone benefits from climate change mitigation policies, and a usage-based charge would result in some NEB program participants paying nothing. The court found that the PUC rationally concluded that NEB costs were not a component of traditional transmission and distribution service for which costs are allocated based on cost of service. The court also rejected the argument that rate design could not be based on the principle that all users benefit from climate change policies.

The ADA’s preemption clause provides that states “may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier.” The plaintiff asserted a claim under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA) and a breach of contract claim based on allegations that KLM misled consumers with its “Fly Responsibly” initiative, which committed the airline to greenhouse gas emissions reductions consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement. (The plaintiff originally also brought an unjust enrichment claim but later withdrew it.) The plaintiff alleged that no credible evidence supported the claim that purchase of carbon credits, including for reforestation projects, would negate the effects of flying. The plaintiff also alleged that KLM’s limited use of sustainable aviation fuels would have a negligible impact on emissions. The court found that the VCPA claim was preempted because it relied upon enforcement of state law and because the plaintiff’s argument that KLM’s climate change-related marketing was misleading “certainly relates” to KLM’s service. The court also found that the ADA preempted the breach of contract claim. The court first noted that “the contours of the alleged contract are unclear” and also rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant’s climate-related advertising should be incorporated into the terms of the contract. The court found, however, that the “larger issue” was that the breach of contract claim did not fit within an exception to ADA preemption for breach of contract claims alleging a defendant’s “breach of its own, self-imposed undertaking,” without “enlargement or enhancement based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.” The court found that the plaintiff’s breach of contract claim was a “thinly veiled repackaging of his VCPA claim” (i.e., based on state laws or policies) and that the preemption exception therefore did not apply. Long v. Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, N.V., No. 3:23-cv-00435 (E.D. Va. Aug. 26, 2024)\nOn August 13, the federal district court for the District of Maryland held that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted a plaintiff’s climate washing claims against United Airlines, Inc. (United). The plaintiff asserted a claim under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act and a common law fraud claim (later withdrawn), alleging that he paid more to fly on United because the company was committed to reducing the impacts of flying, including by using sustainable aviation fuel. He alleged he would not have paid more had he known that only .025% of United’s fuel supply was SAF and that SAF still emits carbon dioxide and other pollutants. The court “easily” concluded that the MCPA claim related to United’s provision of transportation services and was therefore preempted by the ADA. The court further concluded that the claim should be dismissed with prejudice because “the deceptive provision of services is the heart of the claim,” and the plaintiff would not be able to amend the claim to escape dismissal. Zajac v. United Airlines, Inc., No. 8:23-cv-03145-PX (D. Md. Aug. 13, 2024)\nDECISIONS AND SETTLEMENTS\nTenth Circuit Vacated 2020 District Court Decision Holding that 2016 Waste Prevention Rule Exceeded BLM’s Authority; Petition for Rehearing Filed\nAfter the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) adopted a final rule in April 2024 that aimed to reduce waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian leases, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a district court’s 2020 ruling and judgment that vacated portions of the Obama administration’s 2016 rule that also aimed to reduce waste of natural gas. The district court held that the 2016 rule exceeded BLM’s authority under the Mineral Leasing Act and that BLM acted arbitrarily and capriciously in adopting the rule. The Tenth Circuit noted that all appellate parties agreed that the appeal from the district court’s 2020 ruling and judgment should be dismissed as moot. The Tenth Circuit further concluded, however, that it was appropriate to follow the general rule of vacating the district court’s ruling when a case becomes moot during appeal. Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, Montana, Western Energy Alliance, and Independent Petroleum Association of America (Petitioners) had argued that the district court’s ruling should be left in place because some of the appellants were responsible for delaying the appeal until the regulation 2016 regulation was replaced, but the Tenth Circuit was not persuaded. The Tenth Circuit noted that practitioners and courts could continue to consult the district court’s 2020 ruling “for its potential value as persuasive authority.” Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, and Texas have filed a separate lawsuit in the District of North Dakota challenging the 2024 rule. On August 27, the Petitioners asked the Tenth Circuit for panel rehearing requesting either that the court not vacate the district court’s judgment or clarify that BLM may not retroactively enforce the 2016 rule. Wyoming v. U.S. Department of the Interior, No. 20-8072 (10th Cir. Aug. 13, 2024)\nD.C. Circuit Vacated FERC Reauthorization of Texas LNG Terminals and Gas Pipeline but Rejected Challenges to Analysis of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC’s) reauthorization of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in Cameron County, Texas, and a pipeline to carry gas to one of the terminals. FERC reauthorized the projects on remand from an earlier D.C. Circuit decision that found that FERC failed to adequately analyze climate change and environmental justice impacts. In considering FERC’s reauthorization, the D.C. Circuit found that FERC erred by declining to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement to address its “entirely new and significantly expanded environmental justice analysis that reached new conclusions” and by failing to consider a proposed carbon capture and sequestration system for one of the terminals as part of its supplemental environmental review. The D.C. Circuit also found that FERC should have explained why it declined to consider air quality data from an air monitor that was closer to the projects than the monitor from which the project applicant’s analysis drew its data. The D.C. Circuit rejected challenges to FERC’s updated ozone and greenhouse gas analyses. The D.C. Circuit found that FERC had adequately responded to the court’s earlier decision by explaining why a Council on Environmental Quality National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation did not compel use of the social cost of carbon protocol to assess the significance of greenhouse gas emissions. Because it concluded that FERC had adequately explained why the NEPA regulation did not alter the greenhouse gas analysis, the D.C. Circuit also rejected the petitioners’ related argument that FERC did not explain greenhouse gas emissions’ role in its public interest determinations under the Natural Gas Act. In addition, the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider arguments that the petitioners did not make before FERC regarding whether other regulations required FERC to somehow evaluate the significance of greenhouse gas emissions. City of Port Isabel v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Nos. 23-1174, 23-1221 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 6, 2024)\nNew York Federal Court Dismissed Some Defendants from Challenge to State’s Natural Gas Ban\nIn a challenge to New York’s ban on natural gas appliances and infrastructure in certain new construction, the federal district court for the Northern District of New York dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds claims against the New York Department of State, the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council (Code Council), and individual members of the Code Council. The plaintiffs conceded that claims against the Department of State and the Code Council were barred by sovereign immunity but argued unsuccessfully that claims were not barred against individual Code Council members because the members were tasked with implementing the statutory ban by amending the Energy and Building Codes and were thus enforcing state law under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young. The court found that suing the individual members in their official capacity “is little more than an attempt to sue the State under a different name, because those members … do not have a sufficient connection to the enforcement of the relevant statute.” The court noted that although the statute directs the Code Council to incorporate the ban into the Codes, the law specifies that the Secretary of State and county or local governments will have enforcement authorities. The court also noted, moreover, that the Secretary, not the Code Council members, had final authority to review and approve the amendments. The court granted the plaintiffs’ request for dismissal without prejudice in light of “significant uncertainty” regarding whether dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds is jurisdictional (and thus necessarily without prejudice) or an affirmative defense. The court stated, however, that the plaintiffs would not be permitted to amend their complaint against the dismissed defendants. The court declined to limit relief sought against the Secretary of State to prospective relief at this juncture, given that there was no indication the plaintiffs were seeking relief beyond that scope. Mulhern Gas Co. v. Rodriguez, No. 1:23-cv-1267 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2024)\nNew Mexico Federal Court Said Review of Magnesium Processing Mill’s Impacts on Air Quality Emissions Was Sufficient\nThe federal district court for the District of New Mexico remanded a case challenging the approval of a magnesium ore mining project to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for additional consideration of water quality impacts but found that BLM otherwise complied with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Land Policy Management Act. The court found that BLM took the required “hard look” at reasonably foreseeable air quality impacts of an off-site processing mill, including impacts on emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and sulfur hexafluoride. Friends of the Floridas v. U.S. Bureau of Land Management, No. 2:20-cv-00924 (D.N.M. Aug. 27, 2024)\nTrial Set for December 2024 in Endangered Species Act Challenge to Montana’s Wolf and Coyote Trapping and Snaring Regulations\nThe federal district court for the District of Montana denied motions for summary judgment in advance of a December 2024 bench trial in conservation groups’ lawsuit asserting that Montana’s authorization of wolf and coyote trapping and snaring in grizzly bear habitat would result in unlawful take of grizzly bears under the Endangered Species Act, due in part to increased wintertime grizzly bear activity. Regarding the plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment, the court found that there were unresolved factual issues regarding whether future grizzly bear takings by wolf and coyote traps were reasonably certain. The court also found that questions regarding whether coyote traps and snares threaten grizzly bears prevented partial summary judgment for agricultural groups that intervened as defendants. The court also rejected the defendants’ challenges to the plaintiffs’ notice of intent to sue and granted in part motions to compel expert disclosures. The court noted that the bench trial was scheduled to start on December 2, 2024. Flathead-Lolo-Bitterroot Citizen Task Force v. Montana, No. 9:23-cv-00101 (D. Mont. Aug. 28, 2024)\nCalifornia Federal Court Said Environmental Reviews for Post-Wildfire Tree Removal Projects Were Adequate \nThe federal district court for the Northern District of California rejected challenges to the U.S. Forest Service’s environmental review of projects to remove dead and dying trees in nine National Forests in California after wildfires in 2020 and 2021. The court found that the record showed that the Forest Service considered a reasonable range of alternatives, took a hard look at potential environmental impacts, and reasonably determined that the project would not have a significant environmental impact. The plaintiffs had alleged that the Forest Service failed to properly analyze and disclose the project’s impacts on climate change and carbon storage, but the court’s decision did not address these issues. Klamath Forest Alliance v. U.S. Forest Service, No. 3:23-cv-03601 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 23, 2024)\nOregon Federal Court Rejected Challenge to Plaintiffs’ Standing in Lawsuit Regarding Air Force’s Plan to Expand Aircraft Training\nThe federal district court for the District of Oregon adopted a magistrate judge’s findings and recommendation and denied the U.S. Department of the Air Force’s motion to dismiss conservation groups’ lawsuit challenging the expansion of military aircraft trainings over the Owyhee Canyonlands of Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada. The groups’ allegations included that the Air Force failed to take a hard look at adverse impacts, including how climate change would exacerbate impacts on resources. The magistrate judge found that the plaintiff organizations’ allegations were sufficient to establish associational standing even though the complaint did not specifically identify individual members whose interests would be impaired. Oregon Natural Desert Association v. U.S. Department of the Air Force, No. 2:24-cv-00145 (D. Or. Aug. 23, 2024)\nFederal Court Said Coal Mine Owner’s Action to Compel Accelerated EIS Schedule Was Prudentially Unripe\nThe federal district court for the District of Columbia granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the owner and operator of an underground coal mine in Montana alleging that federal defendants violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by setting a schedule for completing an environmental impact statement (EIS) for expansion of the mine after expiration of NEPA’s statutory deadlines. NEPA, as amended in 2023, requires that an EIS be completed two years after certain trigger dates. In this case, the plaintiff contended that the trigger date was December 2, 2022, when the federal defendants represented that an EIS would be required after the Ninth Circuit found that the defendants violated NEPA, including by failing to provide an explanation for the conclusion that the mine expansion’s greenhouse gas emissions would not be significant. In February 2024, the defendants issued a schedule that projected completion of the EIS in May 2026. The district court found that the coal mine owner-operator had organizational standing because it alleged a sufficient procedural injury, as well as “necessary drain on its resources,” that were traceable to the defendants’ actions and redressable by judicial action. The court further found, however, that the case was prudentially unripe because the defendants had not yet missed the alleged deadline and the owner-operator was not likely to suffer further hardship from deferred judicial review. The court also denied conservation groups’ motion to intervene. Signal Peak Energy, LLC v. Haaland, No. 1:24-cv-00366 (D.D.C. Aug. 21, 2024)\nFederal Court Vacated Biological Opinion for Gulf of Mexico Oil and Gas Development\nThe federal district court for the District of Maryland ruled that the 2020 biological opinion (BiOp) for oil and gas extraction in the Gulf of Mexico violated the Endangered Species Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. The court vacated the BiOp effective December 20, 2024 and remanded to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). This case had been stayed in August 2023 pursuant to an agreement pursuant to which the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management would implement measures to protect the Rice’s whale during a reinitiated consultation process. After oil and gas industry intervenor-defendants and the State of Louisiana successfully challenged the inclusion of two of the measures in Lease Sale 261 in the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana, the stay was lifted in January 2024. The court’s decision vacating the BiOp found that the BiOp underestimated the risk and harms of oil spills to protected species; that the jeopardy analysis improperly assumed that the Rice’s whale and Gulf sturgeon populations remained as large as they were before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; that the “reasonably prudent alternative” addressed only two stressors likely to jeopardize the Rice’s whale; and that the incidental take statement failed to recognize oil spill take as incidental take and did not rationally quantify the number of listed species taken by vessel strikes. The court said it was not necessary to reach certain arguments made by the plaintiffs, including two climate change-related arguments: (1) that historical spill data used by NMFS did not account for increased risk of a catastrophic spill due to factors that included climate change and (2) that NMFS failed to properly account for climate change in its jeopardy analyses. Sierra Club v. National Marine Fisheries Service, No. 20-cv-3060 (D. Md. Aug. 19, 2024)\nPennsylvania Federal Court Declined to Dismiss Climate Change Event Organizers’ First Amendment Claims Against City of Harrisburg\nThe federal district court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denied the City of Harrisburg and the Harrisburg mayor’s motion to dismiss First Amendment claims brought by the organizers of an annual event to raise awareness about climate change. The court found that the plaintiffs’ allegations, taken as true, adequately stated claims that the City’s requirements for use of a City park, the fees allegedly charged for use of City streets and sidewalks, and the permitting scheme for banners on City-owned utility poles violated the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. Better Path Coalition Planning Group v. City of Harrisburg, No. 1:22-cv-00623 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 19, 2024)\nChallenge to Berkeley Natural Gas Ban Dismissed After Repeal of Law\nOn August 12, 2024, California Restaurant Association (CRA) and the City of Berkeley filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal without prejudice of CRA’s lawsuit challenging the City’s ban on natural gas infrastructure in new construction. The parties’ stipulation stated that they had “resolved this case in its entirety.” After the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Energy Policy and Conservation Act preempted the Berkeley ordinance, the City repealed the law in May 2024. California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley, No. 3:19-cv-07668 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2024)\nFish and Wildlife Service Proposed to List Climate Change-Threatened Cedar Key Mole Skink as Endangered After Settlement in Challenge to 2018 Decision Not to List\nAfter reaching an agreement with Center for Biological Diversity in 2022 to resolve a lawsuit challenging the 2018 determination that listing of the Cedar Key mole skink under the Endangered Species Act was not warranted, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) on August 8, 2024 published a proposal to list the species as endangered and to designate 2,713 acres of critical habitat in Levy County, Cedar Keys, Florida. FWS determined that the Cedar Key mole skink was endangered due to threats associated with climate change, specifically sea level rise, increased high tide flooding, and increased intensity of storm events. Center for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, No. 2:22-cv-14038 (S.D. Fla.)\nMontana Federal Court Vacated Decision Not to List Upper Missouri River Arctic Grayling Under Endangered Species Act but Found that Climate Change Was Adequately Considered\nIn a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS’s) 2020 finding that listing of the upper Missouri River distinct population segment of Arctic grayling was not warranted, the federal district court for the District of Montana agreed with the plaintiffs regarding two aspects of FWS’s analysis but rejected other arguments, including an argument that FWS “irrationally and unlawfully dismissed climate-change threats.” FWS made the 2020 finding on remand from a 2018 Ninth Circuit decision finding that a 2014 finding that listing was not warranted included four errors. One error involved FWS’s reliance on cold water refugia that information showed would experience low stream flows and high water temperatures. Another error identified by the Ninth Circuit was a failure to adequately explain why uncertainty created by climate change did not weigh in favor of listing. In evaluating FWS’s 2020 finding, the district court found that FWS did not act arbitrarily or capriciously or contrary to law when it addressed higher water temperatures and low stream flows, the grayling’s ability to access thermal refugia, and thermal threats to the Ruby River grayling population. The court also found that the defendants adequately considered the cumulative effects of climate change, noting that FWS supplemented its earlier climate change analysis with new studies that provided information about interactions between climate change and other potential stressors. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that FWS’s reliance on benefits of a candidate conservation agreement with assurances between FWS and non-federal property owners without considering that it might cease to exist was arbitrary and capricious. The court also found that the determination that the Ruby River grayling population was viable and would provide redundancy was arbitrary and capricious. Center for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, No. 2:23-cv-00002 (D. Mont. Aug. 6, 2024)\nFederal Court Dismissed Pro Se Plaintiff’s Lawsuit Alleging that Universities Failed to Adequately Educate Students About Climate Change\nThe federal district court for the Southern District of New York dismissed a lawsuit brought by a pro se plaintiff against four universities in New York and New Jersey, seeking to block them from “teaching their students, and thereby the public, that the future … will be one where climate change is manageable, and sustainability is achievable.” The court found that the plaintiff did not allege a concrete and particularized injury, only “generalized grievances.” The plaintiff therefore lacked standing. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to state any claim under the National Environmental Policy Act. Anderson v. State University of New York (SUNY), No. 1:24CV02083 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2024)\nOregon Federal Court Dismissed Claims Challenging Portland Restrictions on Bulk Fossil Fuel Terminals\nThe federal district court for the District of Oregon found that at least one plaintiff had standing to challenge City of Portland land use restrictions on new or expanded bulk fossil fuel terminals but granted the City’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court agreed with a magistrate judge’s recommendation that the plaintiffs’ allegations were not sufficient to state a dormant Commerce Clause or Foreign Commerce Clause claim, that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for preemption under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, and that they failed to allege a substantive due process claim. The district court declined to adopt two aspects of the magistrate judge’s dormant Commerce Clause analysis. Montana v. City of Portland, No. 3:23-cv-00219 (D. Or. July 5, 2024)\nFederal Court Rejected Challenge to Forest Management Project\nThe federal district court for the District of Oregon found that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) complied with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Land Policy Management Act when it approved the Big Weekly Elk Forest Management Project and associated timber sales. The court’s decision did not address the complaint’s allegations that BLM failed to take a hard look at the project’s impacts on carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs appealed. Cascadia Wildlands v. U.S. Bureau of Land Management, No. 6:23-cv-01358 (D. Or. June 28, 2024)\nLouisiana Federal Court Found that Incarcerated Persons Were Entitled to Preliminary Injunctive Relief in Eighth Amendment Challenge to Heat Conditions on Angola Farm Line; Fifth Circuit Stayed Portions of Relief\nThe federal district court for the Middle District of Louisiana granted in part an application by incarcerated persons who labor on the “Farm Line” at the Angola penitentiary in Louisiana for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order enjoining agricultural labor on the Farm Line when heat index values exceed 88°F. The court found that the evidence at this stage showed that Angola’s heat-related policies were inadequate to mitigate risks of heat-related disorders, resulting in a substantial risk of serious harm. The court said the “worsening climate situation” in Louisiana and Angola compounded the inadequacies of the policies. The court further found that plaintiffs had shown a substantial likelihood of establishing that the defendants had been deliberately indifferent to these risks in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court also found that the plaintiffs showed an immediate risk of irreparable injury and that the balance of interests favored an injunction. Citing the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) provision limiting relief in prison conditions lawsuits to remedies that reduce risk to “a socially acceptable level,” the court did not entirely enjoin operation of the Farm Line when the 88°F threshold was reached but instead ordered the defendants to “take immediate measures to correct the glaring deficiencies in their heat-related policies.” The court listed five sets of actions that the defendants were required take and required them to submit a memorandum regarding proposed remedies. The defendants appealed, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed three of the five required sets of actions, but not portions of the ruling that pertained to addressing deficiencies in the defendants’ policies regarding shade, rest, and provision of adequate protective gear. The Fifth Circuit found that the three stayed portions of the district court’s ruling reached beyond persons working on the Farm Line and that the relief was therefore overbroad under the PLRA. The Fifth Circuit also found that evidence did not demonstrate the defendants’ deliberate indifference with respect to the stayed portions of the district court’s order. On August 15, 2024, the district court issued a ruling and order finding that the defendants’ remedies in response to its order had been inadequate and directing them to take additional steps, including providing additional tents to provide shade and making changes to the break schedule. Voice of the Experienced v. LeBlanc, No. 3:23-cv-01304 (M.D. La. July 2, 2024 and Aug. 15, 2024), No. 24-30420 (5th Cir. July 5, 2024)\nIllinois Federal Court Found that Crypto Hedge Fund Operators Defrauded Investors with Carbon Offset Bond Product\nThe federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois found that defendants who operated “crypto hedge funds” whose investment products included “carbon offset bonds” (COBs) committed civil violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which brought the suit, described the COBs as promissory notes advertised as offering a collateral (Base Carbon Tons tokens) as security. The court found that the defendants defrauded investors by making material misrepresentations of fact. With respect to the COBs, the court found, for instance, that the defendants failed to inform COB purchasers that the same digital wallet holding the collateral was pledged as collateral to dozens of purchasers. The court also found that the CFTC established that the defendants misappropriated funds through the carbon offset program in a “classic Ponzi scheme” in which the defendants bought out investors in a collapsed fund at a pre-crash price, leaving the defendants with insufficient funds to pay COB participants what they were owed. The court also found that the defendants failed to register as a commodity pool operator (CPO) and committed CPO fraud. The court ordered restitution in the amount of customer losses (more than $85 million) and ordered disgorgement of collected commissions (almost $37 million). Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Ikkurty, No. 1:22-cv-02465 (N.D. Ill. July 1, 2024)\nD.C. Court of Appeals Reinstated Greenwashing Suit Against Coca-Cola\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of a deceptive marketing lawsuit against Coca-Cola Company under the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA). The plaintiff, Earth Island Institute, alleged that Coca-Cola misled consumers regarding its environmental sustainability with statements that touted the company’s efforts to address packaging waste when the company actually was failing to take necessary steps to meet its sustainability goals. Allegedly misleading statements included that the company was taking a “leadership position” on the “interconnected global challenges of packaging waste and climate change.” As a threshold matter, the court found that Earth Island Institute had standing to bring the CPPA claim. On the merits, the Court of Appeals found that the plaintiff stated a facially plausible misrepresentation and rejected arguments that “aspirational” statements could not be actionable under the CPPA. The Court of Appeals also found that Coca-Cola’s claims regarding plastic packaging were “very much statements about its ‘goods and services’” for purposes of the CPPA. The appellate court also held that misleading misrepresentations did not have to be in a single statement to be actionable under the CPPA. In addition, the court rejected Coca-Cola’s argument that the First Amendment precluded the lawsuit. Earth Island Institute v. Coca-Cola Co., No. 22-CV-0895 (D.C. Aug. 29, 2024)\nMaine High Court Upheld Utility Cost Allocation for Costs to Implement Climate Change-Related Policies\nThe Maine Supreme Judicial Court upheld a Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) order regarding the allocation to ratepayers of utilities’ costs related to power supply obligations and State energy programs, including “net energy billing” (NEB), a renewable energy incentive program. The PUC determined costs should be allocated to each class (residential, commercial, industrial) according to the class’s overall load share and that NEB costs should be recovered within each rate class through a fixed customer charge that did not change based on power usage. The PUC concluded that a fixed customer charge for NEB cost recovery was appropriate because everyone benefits from climate change mitigation policies, and a usage-based charge would result in some NEB program participants paying nothing. The court found that the PUC rationally concluded that NEB costs were not a component of traditional transmission and distribution service for which costs are allocated based on cost of service. The court also rejected the argument that rate design could not be based on the principle that all users benefit from climate change policies. The court found that the Maine Legislature “expressly requires the Commission to consider policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” The court also concluded that the appeal was timely and not barred by collateral estoppel and that the allocation and rate design did not violate State statutes. The court declined to consider the argument that the Federal P","{'tone': 'Urgent', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'summary': 'The comments express grave concern about the rapidly worsening climate crisis, highlighting the severity of the situation and the dire consequences if drastic action is not taken soon.

This year is setting up to be a momentous year in the movement for climate action. Scroll through your newsfeed, scan the day's headlines, and chances are you'll see something about climate change.
This is good news. Largely because, as the latest IPCC report published in March made extremely clear, we are out of time for talking. We have to see urgent and widespread action on climate change right now — and that means global, systemic transformation.
But it can get overwhelming. Both in terms of eco-anxiety — an international study in 2021 revealed that 60% of young people were very worried about climate change — but also in terms of the sheer amount of information to know.
International climate policy isn’t exactly taught in school (although many, such as activist Scarlett Westbrook, argue it should be) and a barrage of media stories might have left you wondering what the difference is between your ""net zero"", your “NDCs”, and your “nature-based solutions.”
So to help, here’s a handy glossary of all the climate-related words and phrases you should know about.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns within global or regional climate patterns. The main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels — such as coal, oil, and gas — to produce energy and power transport.
In addition to other human activities, like cutting down forests and farming, this releases heat-trapping pollution (called greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere, warming the planet and destabilizing the climate.
Climate change is already having a devastating impact on people all around the world, particularly through extreme weather events like heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, droughts, and floods. Climate change is also disproportionately impacting the world's poorest people and nations the most, despite these populations having contributed the least to climate change.
The climate crisis refers to the urgent need for immediate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and address the causes of climate change, and prevent serious and permanent damage to the environment.
Global warming refers to a long-term warming of the Earth’s surface overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Human activity has played a huge role in the increase of our planet’s temperature. Burning fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gases, which cause what's known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere — which locks heat into the earth's atmosphere and causes the average global temperature to rise.
Learn more about global warming and its causes and effects in our explainer here.
Fossil fuel is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources such as coal, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from dead plants and animals that existed millions of years ago, and can also be made by industrial processes from other fossil fuels.
When fossil fuels are burned they release harmful gases into the atmosphere and cause global warming (see above!). Fossil fuels currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy.
Debates about climate policy often refer to the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where did this limit come from, and why?
It refers to how we are tracking the world’s temperature in comparison to pre-industrial temperatures. The world is already 1.2C degrees warmer, and we’re seeing changes in weather and the climate as a result.
The idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body founded in 1988 to regularly assess all the available science on the changing global climate. Scientific predictions have been made about what the likely effect of incremental temperature rises would be — you can read about the differences between a 1.5, 2, and 3 degree rise here.
The Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015 committed all 196 countries that signed it to endeavoring to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees.
Loss and damage is a phrase you'll likely hear a lot, and it refers, to quote the UN Environment Program, ""to the negative consequences that arise from the unavoidable risks of climate change"" — things like, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more. There's no internationally agreed definition for loss and damage, but it typically refers to the destructive impacts of climate change.
When capitalized, Loss and Damage is typically used when referring to international climate negotiations and the plans and policies that address loss and damage. Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.
It’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.
With sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.
Climate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.
Dedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change's impacts.
In short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.
It is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.
At the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.
Find out more here about climate finance here.
Nature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.
These are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.
Forests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.
The goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”
That’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.
Net zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.
A number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.
Climate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.
It acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently — with the world's poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change — and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.
Renewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.
Extreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns — and it's becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we've witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.
Carbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).
The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.
It has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.
Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren't money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.
In a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.
The world’s biggest climate summit is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.
The COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.
The summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.
COP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”
Something that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.
These plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.
Currently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.
A climate refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It's estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.
There are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.
SIDS —  Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10. AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.

“Crisis” is an incredibly potent word, so it’s interesting to witness the way the phrase “climate crisis” has become part of the lingua franca.
Once associated only with a few “outspoken” scientists and activists, the phrase has now gone mainstream.
But what do people understand by the term “climate crisis”? And why does it matter?
The mainstreaming of crisis-talk
It’s not only activists or scientists sounding the alarm.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres now routinely employs dramatic phrases like “digging our own graves” when discussing climate. Bill Gates advises us to avoid “climate disaster”.
This linguistic mainstreaming marks redrawn battle lines in the “climate wars”.
Denialism is in retreat. The climate change debate now is about what is to be done and by whom?
Scientists, using the full authority of their profession, have been key to changing the discourse. The lead authors of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports now pull no punches, talking openly about mass starvation, extinctions and disasters.

An official welcome to the Anthropocene epoch – but who gets to decide it's here?
These public figures clearly hope to jolt citizens, businesses and governments into radical climate action.
But for many ordinary folks, climate change can seem remote from everyday life. It’s not a “crisis” in the immediate way the pandemic has been.
Of course, many believe climate experts have understated the problem for too long.
And yet the new ubiquity of siren terms like climate “crisis”, “emergency”, “disaster”, “breakdown” and “calamity” does not guarantee any shared, let alone credible, understanding of their possible meaning.
This matters because such terms tend to polarise.
Few now doubt the reality of climate change. But how we describe its implications can easily repeat earlier stand-offs between “believers” and “sceptics”; “realists’ and ""scare-mongerers”. The result is yet more political inertia and gridlock.
We will need to do better.
Four ideas for a new way forward
Terms like “climate crisis” are here to stay. But scientists, teachers and
politicians need to be savvy. A keen awareness of what other people may think when they hear us shout “crisis!” can lead to better communication.
Here are four ideas to keep in mind.
1. We must challenge dystopian and salvation narratives
A crisis is when things fall apart. We see news reports of crises daily – floods in Pakistan, economic collapse in Sri Lanka, famine in parts of Africa.
But “climate crisis” signifies something that feels beyond the range of ordinary experience, especially to the wealthy. People quickly reach for culturally available ideas to fill the vacuum.
One is the notion of an all-encompassing societal break down, where only a few survive. Cormac McCarthy’s bleak book The Road is one example.
Central to many apocalyptic narratives is the idea technology and a few brave people (usually men) can save the day in the nick of time, as in films like Interstellar.
The problem, of course, is these (often fanciful) depictions aren’t suitable ways to interpret what climate scientists have been warning people about. The world is far more complicated.
2. We must bring the climate crisis home and make it present now
Even if they’re willing to acknowledge it as a looming crisis, many think climate change impacts will be predominantly felt elsewhere or in the distant future.
The disappearance of Tuvalu as sea levels rise is an existential crisis for its citizens but may seem a remote, albeit tragic, problem to people in Chicago, Oslo or Cape Town.
But the recent floods in eastern Australia and the heatwave in Europe allow a powerful point to be made: no place is immune from extreme weather as the planet heats up.
There won’t be a one-size-fits-all global climate crisis as per many Hollywood movies. Instead, people must understand global warming will trigger myriad local-to-regional scale crises.
Many will be on the doorstep, many will last for years or decades. Most will be made worse if we don’t act now. Getting people to understand this is crucial.
3. We must explain: a crisis in relation to what?
The climate wars showed us value disputes get transposed into arguments about scientific evidence and its interpretation.
A crisis occurs when events are judged in light of certain values, such as people’s right to adequate food, healthcare and shelter.
Pronouncements of crisis need to explain the values that underpin judgements about unacceptable risk, harm and loss.
Historians, philosophers, legal scholars and others help us to think clearly about our values and what exactly we mean when we say “crisis”.
4. We must appreciate other crises and challenges matter more to many people
Some are tempted to occupy the moral high ground and imply the climate crisis is so grand as to eclipse all others. This is understandable but imprudent.
It’s important to respect other perspectives and negotiate a way forward. Consider, for example, the way author Bjørn Lomborg has questioned the climate emergency by arguing it’s not the main threat.
Lomborg was widely pilloried. But his arguments resonated with many. We may disagree with him, but his views are not irrational.
We must seek to understand how and why this kind of argument makes sense to so many people.
Words matter. It’s vital terms like “crisis” and “calamity” don’t become rhetorical devices devoid of real content as we argue about what climate action to take.

The climate change debate now is about what is to be done and by whom?\nScientists, using the full authority of their profession, have been key to changing the discourse. The lead authors of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports now pull no punches, talking openly about mass starvation, extinctions and disasters.\nRead more:\nAn official welcome to the Anthropocene epoch – but who gets to decide it\'s here?\nThese public figures clearly hope to jolt citizens, businesses and governments into radical climate action.\nBut for many ordinary folks, climate change can seem remote from everyday life. It’s not a “crisis” in the immediate way the pandemic has been.\nOf course, many believe climate experts have understated the problem for too long.\nAnd yet the new ubiquity of siren terms like climate “crisis”, “emergency”, “disaster”, “breakdown” and “calamity” does not guarantee any shared, let alone credible, understanding of their possible meaning.\nThis matters because such terms tend to polarise.\nFew now doubt the reality of climate change. But how we describe its implications can easily repeat earlier stand-offs between “believers” and “sceptics”; “realists’ and ""scare-mongerers”. The result is yet more political inertia and gridlock.\nWe will need to do better.\nFour ideas for a new way forward\nTerms like “climate crisis” are here to stay. But scientists, teachers and\npoliticians need to be savvy. A keen awareness of what other people may think when they hear us shout “crisis!” can lead to better communication.\nHere are four ideas to keep in mind.\n1. We must challenge dystopian and salvation narratives\nA crisis is when things fall apart. We see news reports of crises daily – floods in Pakistan, economic collapse in Sri Lanka, famine in parts of Africa.\nBut “climate crisis” signifies something that feels beyond the range of ordinary experience, especially to the wealthy. People quickly reach for culturally available ideas to fill the vacuum.\nOne is the notion of an all-encompassing societal break down, where only a few survive. Cormac McCarthy’s bleak book The Road is one example.\nCentral to many apocalyptic narratives is the idea technology and a few brave people (usually men) can save the day in the nick of time, as in films like Interstellar.\nThe problem, of course, is these (often fanciful) depictions aren’t suitable ways to interpret what climate scientists have been warning people about. The world is far more complicated.\n2. We must bring the climate crisis home and make it present now\nEven if they’re willing to acknowledge it as a looming crisis, many think climate change impacts will be predominantly felt elsewhere or in the distant future.\nThe disappearance of Tuvalu as sea levels rise is an existential crisis for its citizens but may seem a remote, albeit tragic, problem to people in Chicago, Oslo or Cape Town.\nBut the recent floods in eastern Australia and the heatwave in Europe allow a powerful point to be made: no place is immune from extreme weather as the planet heats up.\nThere won’t be a one-size-fits-all global climate crisis as per many Hollywood movies. Instead, people must understand global warming will trigger myriad local-to-regional scale crises.\nMany will be on the doorstep, many will last for years or decades. Most will be made worse if we don’t act now. Getting people to understand this is crucial.\n3. We must explain: a crisis in relation to what?\nThe climate wars showed us value disputes get transposed into arguments about scientific evidence and its interpretation.\nA crisis occurs when events are judged in light of certain values, such as people’s right to adequate food, healthcare and shelter.\nPronouncements of crisis need to explain the values that underpin judgements about unacceptable risk, harm and loss.\nHistorians, philosophers, legal scholars and others help us to think clearly about our values and what exactly we mean when we say “crisis”.\n4. We must appreciate other crises and challenges matter more to many people\nSome are tempted to occupy the moral high ground and imply the climate crisis is so grand as to eclipse all others. This is understandable but imprudent.\nIt’s important to respect other perspectives and negotiate a way forward. Consider, for example, the way author Bjørn Lomborg has questioned the climate emergency by arguing it’s not the main threat.\nLomborg was widely pilloried. But his arguments resonated with many. We may disagree with him, but his views are not irrational.\nWe must seek to understand how and why this kind of argument makes sense to so many people.\nWords matter. It’s vital terms like “crisis” and “calamity” don’t become rhetorical devices devoid of real content as we argue about what climate action to take.\nRead more:\nMass starvation, extinctions, disasters: the new IPCC report’s grim predictions, and why adaptation efforts are falling behind\nWant to write?\nWrite an article and join a growing community of more than 188,500 academics and researchers from 5,029 institutions.\nRegister now\nCopyright © 2010–2024, The Conversation US, Inc.'}]","{'tone': 'Pessimistic', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'summary': 'The main point of the comments is that the current political and societal response to climate change has eroded hope, leading to a sense of resignation and despair about the future.

This year is setting up to be a momentous year in the movement for climate action. Scroll through your newsfeed, scan the day's headlines, and chances are you'll see something about climate change.
This is good news. Largely because, as the latest IPCC report published in March made extremely clear, we are out of time for talking. We have to see urgent and widespread action on climate change right now — and that means global, systemic transformation.
But it can get overwhelming. Both in terms of eco-anxiety — an international study in 2021 revealed that 60% of young people were very worried about climate change — but also in terms of the sheer amount of information to know.
International climate policy isn’t exactly taught in school (although many, such as activist Scarlett Westbrook, argue it should be) and a barrage of media stories might have left you wondering what the difference is between your ""net zero"", your “NDCs”, and your “nature-based solutions.”
So to help, here’s a handy glossary of all the climate-related words and phrases you should know about.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns within global or regional climate patterns. The main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels — such as coal, oil, and gas — to produce energy and power transport.
In addition to other human activities, like cutting down forests and farming, this releases heat-trapping pollution (called greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere, warming the planet and destabilizing the climate.
Climate change is already having a devastating impact on people all around the world, particularly through extreme weather events like heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, droughts, and floods. Climate change is also disproportionately impacting the world's poorest people and nations the most, despite these populations having contributed the least to climate change.
The climate crisis refers to the urgent need for immediate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and address the causes of climate change, and prevent serious and permanent damage to the environment.
Global warming refers to a long-term warming of the Earth’s surface overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Human activity has played a huge role in the increase of our planet’s temperature. Burning fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gases, which cause what's known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere — which locks heat into the earth's atmosphere and causes the average global temperature to rise.
Learn more about global warming and its causes and effects in our explainer here.
Fossil fuel is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources such as coal, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from dead plants and animals that existed millions of years ago, and can also be made by industrial processes from other fossil fuels.
When fossil fuels are burned they release harmful gases into the atmosphere and cause global warming (see above!). Fossil fuels currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy.
Debates about climate policy often refer to the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where did this limit come from, and why?
It refers to how we are tracking the world’s temperature in comparison to pre-industrial temperatures. The world is already 1.2C degrees warmer, and we’re seeing changes in weather and the climate as a result.
The idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body founded in 1988 to regularly assess all the available science on the changing global climate. Scientific predictions have been made about what the likely effect of incremental temperature rises would be — you can read about the differences between a 1.5, 2, and 3 degree rise here.
The Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015 committed all 196 countries that signed it to endeavoring to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees.
Loss and damage is a phrase you'll likely hear a lot, and it refers, to quote the UN Environment Program, ""to the negative consequences that arise from the unavoidable risks of climate change"" — things like, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more. There's no internationally agreed definition for loss and damage, but it typically refers to the destructive impacts of climate change.
When capitalized, Loss and Damage is typically used when referring to international climate negotiations and the plans and policies that address loss and damage. Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.
It’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.
With sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.
Climate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.
Dedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change's impacts.
In short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.
It is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.
At the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.
Find out more here about climate finance here.
Nature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.
These are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.
Forests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.
The goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”
That’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.
Net zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.
A number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.
Climate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.
It acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently — with the world's poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change — and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.
Renewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.
Extreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns — and it's becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we've witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.
Carbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).
The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.
It has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.
Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren't money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.
In a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.
The world’s biggest climate summit is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.
The COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.
The summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.
COP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”
Something that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.
These plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.
Currently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.
A climate refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It's estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.
There are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.
SIDS —  Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10. AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.

Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.\nThe goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”\nThat’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.\nNet zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.\nA number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.\nClimate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.\nIt acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently\xa0— with the world\'s poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change —\xa0and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.\nRenewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.\nExtreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns\xa0— and it\'s becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we\'ve witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.\nCarbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere\xa0and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).\nThe Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries\xa0at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.\nIt has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.\nBiodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren\'t\xa0money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.\nIn a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.\nThe world’s biggest climate summit\xa0is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.\nThe COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.\nThe summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.\nCOP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”\nSomething that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit\xa0their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.\nThese plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.\nCurrently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report\xa0by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.\nA climate refugee is a person who has been\xa0forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas\xa0given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It\'s estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.\nThere are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.\nSIDS — \xa0Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10.\xa0AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.\nNow you know all about the key words and phrases relating to climate change, you can join us and Global Citizen around the world in taking action to address climate change.

Gastech 2024 is set to affirm its position as the world’s premier platform for natural gas, LNG, hydrogen, climate technologies, energy manufacturing, and low carbon solutions, as it unfolds from September 17-20 in Houston, USA - the epicenter of the international energy revolution.
The United States has emerged as a dominant force in the global energy landscape, driven by ambitious policies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and private sector enterprise. As a producer and exporter of critical energy resources, the US has rocketed from selling minimal amounts of natural gas and LNG overseas to becoming the world’s top supplier in just 8 years.
Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has accelerated investment into clean technology and fuels, both key components of a resilient and sustainable energy mix that can respond to modern consumption trends – annual global data center energy consumption has risen 20-40% since 2017. A recently proposed expansion of the IRA’s federal clean energy tax credits looks to encourage further development of green energy solutions, including nuclear, geothermal and hydropower.
Transforming energy through vision, innovation and action
Under the theme of “Transforming energy through vision, innovation and action,” Gastech 2024 will address the global forces and domestic priorities that are propelling the US’ transformation - from harnessing growth opportunities for natural gas and elevating hydrogen’s decarbonization potential, to advancing climate technology development and mobilizing capital flows through policy innovation, partnerships, and collaboration.
A central focus of Gastech’s Strategic Conference for 2024 will be promoting natural gas’ strategic advantage as a versatile resource with a low carbon footprint. A cornerstone of the global approach to energy security and sustainability, natural gas is playing an indispensable role in supporting the expansion of electrification in emerging markets, resolving disruptions in traditional supply routes, and enabling decarbonization.
Opportunity for key stakeholders
As such, global gas demand is projected to grow between 10-15% past 2030, and Gastech 2024 will offer an invaluable opportunity for key stakeholders – including more than 500 CEOs, Ministers and global business leaders - to align on the policies and investments needed to enable continued progress and decarbonization in the natural gas sector, as well as the wider energy industry.
Innovation is a key part of the puzzle, enabling those reliant on natural gas and LNG to maximize efficiency while minimizing environmental impacts. Cutting-edge technologies such as CCUS, DAC, and methane leak prevention AI programs are revolutionizing the applicability and viability of these resources, and therefore creating a pragmatic, inclusive and affordable path to net zero. Estimates reveal that most of the reductions in CO2 emissions through 2030 come from technologies already on the market today, while almost half the reductions needed by 2050 will come from technologies that are currently at the demonstration or prototype phase.
Climatetech & AI Conference
Gastech 2024’s Climatetech & AI Conference will identify new routes to investment and scalability for such transformative technologies, aiming to accelerate the solutions that will decarbonize our global energy supply. Benefiting from Houston’s position as a global hub for energy innovation, the Program will feature high-profile speakers from companies leading the climate technologies sector.
Gastech 2024’s commitment to promoting and elevating promising new solutions will also be reflected in the dedicated Hydrogen Conference, as it brings together market shapers, policymakers, and energy producers to develop the strategies necessary to bridge the divide between hydrogen’s potential and its adoption as a transformative force in the global energy system.
Building on recent initiatives such as the US’ National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and COP28’s Declaration of Intent on Mutual Recognition of Certification Schemes for Renewable and Low-carbon Hydrogen and
Hydrogen Derivatives - which have helped generate over US $500 billion in public and private sector financing for hydrogen projects worldwide - the Hydrogen Conference will galvanize the energy industry’s efforts to create a competitive global hydrogen economy, championing the policies and incentives that will unlock its potential as a key component of a stable and sustainable energy future.
Pressing need for widescale decarbonization
Jill Evanko, President & Chief Executive Officer, Chart Industries, said: “Gastech will once again serve as a catalyst for the transformation of the natural gas and LNG sector, as well as the wider energy industry. Chart Industries has long recognized the pressing need for widescale decarbonization, and we have been proud to play our part in developing the technologies and solutions that will make it possible.
“Now, with Gastech 2024 just around the corner, we look forward to collaborating with the leading companies and innovators in attendance and crafting the next generation of game-changing technologies and associated equipment.”
Christopher Hudson, President of Global Energy, dmg events, commented: “Gastech 2024 will capitalize on the incredible momentum unfolding here in the United States, as the world’s most renowned energy leaders – including top CEOs, ministers, and innovators – come together for this unique event and drive the global transformation of our industry, from natural gas and LNG to hydrogen and climate technologies.
“Houston provides the ideal backdrop for this important mission, as the city’s emergence as an international hub for energy production and innovation reflects a necessary commitment to embracing new strategies, solutions, and partnerships that help balance growing energy consumption with impactful progress on global climate goals.”

Module 2: Formulating a Research Question and Searching for Sources

			Identify Search Terms (Keywords)		
Identifying keywords, (also known as search terms) is important for effective literature searching. _Your search terms are terms that will appear somewhere within the resource (e.g. title, abstract, or author keywords).
You can identify search terms from your research question by highlighting, underlining or circling the main ideas that must appear in the article. Your search concepts are the most important words in your research question.
Example
What are the keywords you identify within this research question?
“What is the relationship between flexible work schedules and staff retention?”
Keywords are easier to identify once the research question has been formulated using one of the stated frameworks (e.g. PICO or PS) listed in Table 2.2 of Formulating a Research Question.
Below is an example of how to use the PICO(T) framework to identify search concepts for a specific research question.
Example
Say you have the following research question: How effective is cognitive behavioural therapy in improving mild-to-moderate depression in adolescents? Let’s break down the formula components by concept.

Climate Change Indicators in the United States
Key Findings

The Earth's climate is changing. Temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events âÄì like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures âÄì are already happening. Many of these observed changes are linked to the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, caused by human activities.Â 
EPA partners with more than 40 data contributors from various government agencies, academic institutions, and other organizations to compile a key set ofÂ indicators related to the causes and effects of climate change. The indicators are publishedÂ in EPA's report,Â Climate Change Indicators in the United States, available on this website and in print.Â Explore the indicators below.

Introduction
The EarthâÄôs climate is changing. Scientists are highly confident that many of the observed changes can be linked to the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, which are caused by human activities. Current and future emissions will continue to increase the levels of these gases in our atmosphere for the foreseeable future.
One important way to track and communicate the causes and effects of climate change is through the use of indicators.
U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In the United States, greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities increased by 7 percent from 1990 to 2014 though emissions have decreased since 2005. Carbon dioxide accounts for most of the nationâÄôs emissions and most of the increase since 1990. Electricity generation is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, followed by transportation.
Learn More
Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Worldwide, net emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities increased by 35 percent from 1990 to 2010. Emissions of carbon dioxide, which account for about three-fourths of total emissions, increased by 42 percent over this period.
Learn More
Data sources: World Resources Institute, 2014; Food and Agriculture Organization, 2014
Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases
Historical measurements show that the current global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are unprecedented compared with the past 800,000 years. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased since the beginning of the industrial era. Almost all of this increase is attributable to human activities.
Learn More
Data source: Compilation of 10 underlying datasets
Climate Forcing
Climate forcing refers to a change in the EarthâÄôs energy balance, leading to either a warming or cooling effect. An increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases produces a warming effect over time. From 1990 to 2015, the total warming effect from greenhouse gases added by humans to the EarthâÄôs atmosphere increased by 37 percent. The warming effect associated with carbon dioxide alone increased by 30 percent.
Learn More
Average Temperature
Average temperatures have risen across the contiguous 48 states since 1901, with an increased rate of warming over the past 30 years. Eight of the top 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1998. Average global temperatures show a similar trend, and all of the top 10 warmest years on record worldwide have occurred since 1998. Within the United States, temperatures in parts of the North, the West, and Alaska have increased the most.
Learn More
Data source: NOAA, 2016
High and Low Temperatures
Many extreme temperature conditions are becoming more common. Since the 1970s, unusually hot summer temperatures have become more common in the United States while unusually cold winter temperatures have become less commonâÄîparticularly very cold nights (lows).
Learn More
Data source: NOAA, 2015
Total Precipitation
Total annual precipitation has increased over land areas in the United States and worldwide. Since 1901, precipitation has increased at an average rate of 0.17 inches per decade in the contiguous 48 states and 0.08 inches per decade worldwide. However, shifting weather patterns have caused certain areas, such as the American Southwest, to experience less precipitation than usual.
Learn More
Data source: NOAA, 2016
Heavy Precipitation
In recent years, a higher percentage of precipitation in the United States has come in the form of intense single-day events. Nationwide, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1990. The occurrence of abnormally high annual precipitation totals has also increased.
Learn More
Tropical Cyclone Activity
Tropical storm activity in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico has increased during the past 20 years. Storm intensity is closely related to variations in sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic. However, changes in observation methods over time make it difficult to know for sure whether a longer-term increase in storm activity has occurred.
Learn More
River Flooding
Changes in the frequency and magnitude of river flood events vary by region. Floods have generally become larger across parts of the Northeast and Midwest and smaller in the West, southern Appalachia, and northern Michigan. Large floods have become more frequent across the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and parts of the northern Great Plains, and less frequent in the Southwest and the Rockies.
Learn More
Data source: Slater and Villarini, 2016
Drought
Average drought conditions across the nation have varied since records began in 1895. The 1930s and 1950s saw the most widespread droughts, while the last 50 years have generally been wetter than average. However, specific trends vary by region. A more focused analysis of drought in recent years shows that between 2000 and 2015, roughly 20 to 70 percent of the United States experienced drought at any given time.
Learn More
Ocean Heat
Three independent analyses show that the amount of heat stored in the ocean has increased substantially since the 1950s. Ocean heat content not only determines sea surface temperature, but also affects sea level and currents.
Learn More
Data sources: CSIRO, 2016; MRI/JMA, 2016; NOAA, 2016
Sea Surface Temperature
Ocean surface temperatures increased around the world during the 20thÂ century. Even with some year-to-year variation, the overall increase is clear, and sea surface temperatures have been consistently higher during the past three decades than at any other time since reliable observations began in the late 1800s.
Learn More
Data sources: IPCC, 2013; NOAA, 2016
Sea Level
When averaged over all of the worldâÄôs oceans, sea level has risen at a rate of roughly six-tenths of an inch per decade since 1880. The rate of increase has accelerated in recent years to more than an inch per decade. Changes in sea level relative to the land vary by region. Along the U.S. coastline, sea level has risen the most along the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in some places by more than 8 inches since 1960.
Learn More
Data source: NOAA, 2016
Coastal Flooding
Flooding is becoming more frequent along the U.S. coastline as sea level rises. Nearly every site examined has experienced an increase in coastal flooding since the 1950s. The rate is accelerating in many locations along the East and Gulf coasts. The Mid-Atlantic region suffers the highest number of coastal flood days and has also experienced the largest increase in frequency over time.
Learn More

Ocean Acidity
The ocean has become more acidic over the past few centuries because of increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which dissolves in the water. Higher acidity affects the balance of minerals in the water, which can make it more difficult for certain marine animals to build their protective skeletons or shells.
Learn More
Arctic Sea Ice
Part of the Arctic Ocean is covered by ice year-round. The area covered by ice is typically smallest in September, after the summer melting season. The annual minimum extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased over time, and in September 2012 it was the smallest ever recorded. Arctic ice has also become thinner, which makes it more vulnerable to further melting. March sea ice extent reached a new low in 2015 and hit roughly the same low again in 2016âÄîabout 7 percent less than the 1981âÄì2010 average.
Learn More
Data source: NSIDC, 2016
Antarctic Sea Ice
Antarctic sea ice extent in September and February has increased somewhat over time. The September maximum extent reached the highest level on record in 2014âÄîabout 7 percent larger than the 1981âÄì2010 average. Slight increases in Antarctic sea ice are outweighed by the loss of sea ice in the Arctic during the same time period.
Learn More
Glaciers
Glaciers in the United States and around the world have generally shrunk since the 1960s, and the rate at which glaciers are melting has accelerated over the last decade. The loss of ice from glaciers has contributed to the observed rise in sea level.
Learn More
Data sources: OâÄôNeel et al., 2014; USGS, 2015
Lake Ice
Lakes in the northern United States are freezing later and thawing earlier compared with the 1800s and early 1900s. Freeze dates have shifted later at a rate of roughly half a day to one-and-a-half days per decade, while thaw dates for most of the lakes studied have shifted earlier at a rate of half a day to two days per decade.
Learn More
Snowfall
Total snowfallâÄîthe amount of snow that falls in a particular locationâÄîhas decreased in most parts of the country since widespread records began in 1930. One reason for this decline is that nearly 80 percent of the locations studied have seen a decrease in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow each winter.
Learn More
Data source: Kunkel et al., 2009
Snow Cover
The average portion of North America covered by snow has decreased at a rate of about 3,300 square miles per year since 1972, based on weekly measurements taken throughout the year. There has been much year-to-year variability, however. In the United States, the snow cover season has become shorter by nearly two weeks on average since 1972. By far the largest change has taken place in the spring, with the last day of snow shifting earlier by 19 days.
Learn More
Snowpack
The depth or thickness of snow on the ground (snowpack) in early spring decreased at more than 90 percent of measurement sites in the western United States between 1955 and 2016. Across all sites, snowpack depth declined by an average of 23 percent over the last 50 years.

Data source: Mote and Sharp, 2016
Climate Change and Human Health
Climate change poses many threats to the health and well-being of Americans. Some of these health impacts are already happening in the United States. This section of the report helps to illustrate how climate change can affect human health, and demonstrates how EPAâÄôs climate change indicators advance the dialogue in connecting climate change and human health.
Learn More
Heat-Related Deaths
Since 1979, more than 9,000 Americans were reported to have died as a direct result of heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke. The annual death rate is higher when accounting for deaths in which heat was reported as a contributing factor. Considerable year-to-year variability and certain limitations of the underlying data for this indicator make it difficult to determine whether the United States has experienced long-term trends in the number of deaths classified as âÄúheat-related.âÄù
Learn More
Heat-Related Illnesses
From 2001 to 2010, a total of about 28,000 heat-related hospitalizations were recorded across 20 states. Annual heat-related hospitalization rates ranged from fewer than one case per 100,000 people in some states to nearly four cases per 100,000 in others. People aged 65+ accounted for more heat-related hospitalizations than any other age group, and males were hospitalized for heat-related illnesses more than twice as often as females.
Learn More
Data source: CDC, 2016
Heating and Cooling Degree Days
Heating and cooling degree days measure the difference between outdoor temperatures and the temperatures that people find comfortable indoors. As the U.S. climate has warmed in recent years, heating degree days have decreased and cooling degree days have increased overall, suggesting that Americans need to use less energy for heating and more energy for air conditioning. In this map, âÄúwarmerâÄù colors indicate an increase in temperatures, leading to less of a need to turn on the heatâÄîthat is, fewer heating degree days. âÄúCoolerâÄù colors indicate the opposite.
Learn More
Data source: NOAA, 2016
Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is a bacterial illness spread by ticks that bite humans. Tick habitat and populations are influenced by many factors, including climate. Nationwide, the rate of reported cases of Lyme disease has approximately doubled since 1991. Lyme disease is most common in the Northeast and the upper Midwest, where some states now report 50 to 100 more cases of Lyme disease per 100,000 people than they did in 1991.
Learn More
West Nile Virus
West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes, whose habitat and populations are influenced by temperature and water availability, among other factors. The incidence of West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease in the United States has varied widely from year to year and among geographic regions since tracking began in 2002. No obvious long-term trend can be detected using available data.
Learn More
Length of Growing Season
The average length of the growing season for crops in the contiguous 48 states has increased by nearly two weeks since the beginning of the 20th century. A particularly large and steady increase has occurred over the last 30 years. The observed changes reflect earlier spring warming as well as later arrival of fall frosts.
Learn More
Data source: Kunkel, 2016
Ragweed Pollen Season
Warmer temperatures and later fall frosts allow ragweed plants to produce pollen later into the year, potentially prolonging the allergy season for millions of people. The length of ragweed pollen season has increased at 10 out of 11 locations studied in the central United States and Canada since 1995. The change becomes more pronounced from south to north.
Learn More
Data source: Ziska et al., 2016
Wildfires
Since 1983, the United States has had an average of 72,000 recorded wildfires per year. Of the 10 years with the largest acreage burned, nine have occurred since 2000, with many of the largest increases occurring in western states. The proportion of burned land suffering severe damage each year has ranged from 5 to 21 percent.
Learn More
Streamflow
Changes in temperature, precipitation, snowpack, and glaciers can affect the rate of streamflow and the timing of peak flow. Over the last 75 years, minimum, maximum, and average flows have changed in many parts of the countryâÄîsome higher, some lower. Most of the rivers and streams measured show peak winter-spring runoff happening at least five days earlier than it did in the mid-20th century.
Learn More
Stream Temperature
Stream temperatures have risen throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. From 1960 through 2014, water temperature increased at 79 percent of the stream sites measured in the region. Temperature has risen by an average of 1.2Â°F across all sites and 2.2Â°F at the sites where trends were statistically significant.

Data source: Jastram and Rice, 2015
Great Lakes Water Levels and Temperatures
Water levels in most of the Great Lakes have declined in the last few decades. However, the most recent levels are all within the range of historical variation. Water levels in lakes are influenced by water temperature, which affects evaporation rates and ice formation. Since 1995, average surface water temperatures have increased slightly for each of the Great Lakes.
Learn More
Bird Wintering Ranges
The migration patterns and geographic ranges of some birds have shifted due to changes in temperature or other environmental conditions. Long-term studies have found that bird species in North America have shifted their wintering grounds northward by an average of more than 40 miles since 1966, with several species shifting by hundreds of miles.
Learn More
Data source: National Audubon Society, 2014
Marine Species Distribution
In conjunction with warming ocean waters, the average center of biomass for 105 marine fish and invertebrate species along U.S. coasts shifted northward by about 10 miles between 1982 and 2015. These species also moved an average of 20 feet deeper. Shifts have occurred among several economically important fish and shellfish species. For example, American lobster, red hake, and black sea bassÂ in the Northeast have moved northward by an average of 119 miles.
Learn More
Leaf and Bloom Dates
Leaf growth and flower blooms are examples of natural events whose timing can be influenced by climate change. Observations of lilacs and honeysuckles in the contiguous 48 states suggest that first leaf dates and bloom dates show a great deal of year-to-year variability. Leaf and bloom events are generally happening earlier throughout the North and West but later in much of the South.

Temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events â\x80\x93 like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures â\x80\x93 are already happening. Many of these observed changes are linked to the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, caused by human activities.Â\xa0\nEPA partners with more than 40 data contributors from various government agencies, academic institutions, and other organizations to compile a key set ofÂ\xa0indicators related to the causes and effects of climate change. The indicators are publishedÂ\xa0in EPA's report,Â\xa0Climate Change Indicators in the United States, available on this website and in print.Â\xa0Explore the indicators below.\nExplore Climate Change Indicators\nClimate Connections\nKey Findings\nContents:\nIntroduction\nGreenhouse Gases\nWeather and Climate\nOceans\nSnow and Ice\nHealth and Society\nEcosystems\nMore Information\nIntroduction\nThe Earthâ\x80\x99s climate is changing. Scientists are highly confident that many of the observed changes can be linked to the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, which are caused by human activities. Current and future emissions will continue to increase the levels of these gases in our atmosphere for the foreseeable future.\nOne important way to track and communicate the causes and effects of climate change is through the use of indicators.\nU.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nIn the United States, greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities increased by 7 percent from 1990 to 2014 though emissions have decreased since 2005. Carbon dioxide accounts for most of the nationâ\x80\x99s emissions and most of the increase since 1990. Electricity generation is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, followed by transportation.\nLearn More\nGlobal Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nWorldwide, net emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities increased by 35 percent from 1990 to 2010. Emissions of carbon dioxide, which account for about three-fourths of total emissions, increased by 42 percent over this period.\nLearn More\nData sources: World Resources Institute, 2014; Food and Agriculture Organization, 2014\nAtmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases\nHistorical measurements show that the current global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are unprecedented compared with the past 800,000 years. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased since the beginning of the industrial era. Almost all of this increase is attributable to human activities.\nLearn More\nData source: Compilation of 10 underlying datasets\nClimate Forcing\nClimate forcing refers to a change in the Earthâ\x80\x99s energy balance, leading to either a warming or cooling effect. An increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases produces a warming effect over time. From 1990 to 2015, the total warming effect from greenhouse gases added by humans to the Earthâ\x80\x99s atmosphere increased by 37 percent. The warming effect associated with carbon dioxide alone increased by 30 percent.\nLearn More\nAverage Temperature\nAverage temperatures have risen across the contiguous 48 states since 1901, with an increased rate of warming over the past 30 years. Eight of the top 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1998. Average global temperatures show a similar trend, and all of the top 10 warmest years on record worldwide have occurred since 1998. Within the United States, temperatures in parts of the North, the West, and Alaska have increased the most.\nLearn More\nData source: NOAA, 2016\nHigh and Low Temperatures\nMany extreme temperature conditions are becoming more common. Since the 1970s, unusually hot summer temperatures have become more common in the United States while unusually cold winter temperatures have become less commonâ\x80\x94particularly very cold nights (lows).\nLearn More\nData source: NOAA, 2015\nTotal Precipitation\nTotal annual precipitation has increased over land areas in the United States and worldwide. Since 1901, precipitation has increased at an average rate of 0.17 inches per decade in the contiguous 48 states and 0.08 inches per decade worldwide. However, shifting weather patterns have caused certain areas, such as the American Southwest, to experience less precipitation than usual.\nLearn More\nData source: NOAA, 2016\nHeavy Precipitation\nIn recent years, a higher percentage of precipitation in the United States has come in the form of intense single-day events. Nationwide, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1990. The occurrence of abnormally high annual precipitation totals has also increased.\nLearn More\nTropical Cyclone Activity\nTropical storm activity in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico has increased during the past 20 years. Storm intensity is closely related to variations in sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic. However, changes in observation methods over time make it difficult to know for sure whether a longer-term increase in storm activity has occurred.\nLearn More\nRiver Flooding\nChanges in the frequency and magnitude of river flood events vary by region. Floods have generally become larger across parts of the Northeast and Midwest and smaller in the West, southern Appalachia, and northern Michigan. Large floods have become more frequent across the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and parts of the northern Great Plains, and less frequent in the Southwest and the Rockies.\nLearn More\nData source: Slater and Villarini, 2016\nDrought\nAverage drought conditions across the nation have varied since records began in 1895. The 1930s and 1950s saw the most widespread droughts, while the last 50 years have generally been wetter than average. However, specific trends vary by region. A more focused analysis of drought in recent years shows that between 2000 and 2015, roughly 20 to 70 percent of the United States experienced drought at any given time.\nLearn More\nOcean Heat\nThree independent analyses show that the amount of heat stored in the ocean has increased substantially since the 1950s. Ocean heat content not only determines sea surface temperature, but also affects sea level and currents.\nLearn More\nData sources: CSIRO, 2016; MRI/JMA, 2016; NOAA, 2016\nSea Surface Temperature\nOcean surface temperatures increased around the world during the 20thÂ\xa0century. Even with some year-to-year variation, the overall increase is clear, and sea surface temperatures have been consistently higher during the past three decades than at any other time since reliable observations began in the late 1800s.\nLearn More\nData sources: IPCC, 2013; NOAA, 2016\nSea Level\nWhen averaged over all of the worldâ\x80\x99s oceans, sea level has risen at a rate of roughly six-tenths of an inch per decade since 1880. The rate of increase has accelerated in recent years to more than an inch per decade. Changes in sea level relative to the land vary by region. Along the U.S. coastline, sea level has risen the most along the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in some places by more than 8 inches since 1960.\nLearn More\nData source: NOAA, 2016\nCoastal Flooding\nFlooding is becoming more frequent along the U.S. coastline as sea level rises. Nearly every site examined has experienced an increase in coastal flooding since the 1950s. The rate is accelerating in many locations along the East and Gulf coasts. The Mid-Atlantic region suffers the highest number of coastal flood days and has also experienced the largest increase in frequency over time.\nLearn More\nSource: Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum\nOcean Acidity\nThe ocean has become more acidic over the past few centuries because of increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which dissolves in the water. Higher acidity affects the balance of minerals in the water, which can make it more difficult for certain marine animals to build their protective skeletons or shells.\nLearn More\nArctic Sea Ice\nPart of the Arctic Ocean is covered by ice year-round. The area covered by ice is typically smallest in September, after the summer melting season. The annual minimum extent of Arctic sea ice has decreased over time, and in September 2012 it was the smallest ever recorded. Arctic ice has also become thinner, which makes it more vulnerable to further melting. March sea ice extent reached a new low in 2015 and hit roughly the same low again in 2016â\x80\x94about 7 percent less than the 1981â\x80\x932010 average.\nLearn More\nData source: NSIDC, 2016\nAntarctic Sea Ice\nAntarctic sea ice extent in September and February has increased somewhat over time. The September maximum extent reached the highest level on record in 2014â\x80\x94about 7 percent larger than the 1981â\x80\x932010 average. Slight increases in Antarctic sea ice are outweighed by the loss of sea ice in the Arctic during the same time period.\nLearn More\nGlaciers\nGlaciers in the United States and around the world have generally shrunk since the 1960s, and the rate at which glaciers are melting has accelerated over the last decade. The loss of ice from glaciers has contributed to the observed rise in sea level.\nLearn More\nData sources: Oâ\x80\x99Neel et al., 2014; USGS, 2015\nLake Ice\nLakes in the northern United States are freezing later and thawing earlier compared with the 1800s and early 1900s. Freeze dates have shifted later at a rate of roughly half a day to one-and-a-half days per decade, while thaw dates for most of the lakes studied have shifted earlier at a rate of half a day to two days per decade.\nLearn More\nSnowfall\nTotal snowfallâ\x80\x94the amount of snow that falls in a particular locationâ\x80\x94has decreased in most parts of the country since widespread records began in 1930. One reason for this decline is that nearly 80 percent of the locations studied have seen a decrease in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow each winter.\nLearn More\nData source: Kunkel et al., 2009\nSnow Cover\nThe average portion of North America covered by snow has decreased at a rate of about 3,300 square miles per year since 1972, based on weekly measurements taken throughout the year. There has been much year-to-year variability, however. In the United States, the snow cover season has become shorter by nearly two weeks on average since 1972. By far the largest change has taken place in the spring, with the last day of snow shifting earlier by 19 days.\nLearn More\nSnowpack\nThe depth or thickness of snow on the ground (snowpack) in early spring decreased at more than 90 percent of measurement sites in the western United States between 1955 and 2016. Across all sites, snowpack depth declined by an average of 23 percent over the last 50 years.\nLearn More\nData source: Mote and Sharp, 2016\nClimate Change and Human Health\nClimate change poses many threats to the health and well-being of Americans. Some of these health impacts are already happening in the United States. This section of the report helps to illustrate how climate change can affect human health, and demonstrates how EPAâ\x80\x99s climate change indicators advance the dialogue in connecting climate change and human health.\nLearn More\nHeat-Related Deaths\nSince 1979, more than 9,000 Americans were reported to have died as a direct result of heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke. The annual death rate is higher when accounting for deaths in which heat was reported as a contributing factor. Considerable year-to-year variability and certain limitations of the underlying data for this indicator make it difficult to determine whether the United States has experienced long-term trends in the number of deaths classified as â\x80\x9cheat-related.â\x80\x9d\nLearn More\nHeat-Related Illnesses\nFrom 2001 to 2010, a total of about 28,000 heat-related hospitalizations were recorded across 20 states. Annual heat-related hospitalization rates ranged from fewer than one case per 100,000 people in some states to nearly four cases per 100,000 in others. People aged 65+ accounted for more heat-related hospitalizations than any other age group, and males were hospitalized for heat-related illnesses more than twice as often as females.\nLearn More\nData source: CDC, 2016\nHeating and Cooling Degree Days\nHeating and cooling degree days measure the difference between outdoor temperatures and the temperatures that people find comfortable indoors. As the U.S. climate has warmed in recent years, heating degree days have decreased and cooling degree days have increased overall, suggesting that Americans need to use less energy for heating and more energy for air conditioning. In this map, â\x80\x9cwarmerâ\x80\x9d colors indicate an increase in temperatures, leading to less of a need to turn on the heatâ\x80\x94that is, fewer heating degree days. â\x80\x9cCoolerâ\x80\x9d colors indicate the opposite.\nLearn More\nData source: NOAA, 2016\nLyme Disease\nLyme disease is a bacterial illness spread by ticks that bite humans. Tick habitat and populations are influenced by many factors, including climate. Nationwide, the rate of reported cases of Lyme disease has approximately doubled since 1991. Lyme disease is most common in the Northeast and the upper Midwest, where some states now report 50 to 100 more cases of Lyme disease per 100,000 people than they did in 1991.\nLearn More\nWest Nile Virus\nWest Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes, whose habitat and populations are influenced by temperature and water availability, among other factors. The incidence of West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease in the United States has varied widely from year to year and among geographic regions since tracking began in 2002. No obvious long-term trend can be detected using available data.\nLearn More\nLength of Growing Season\nThe average length of the growing season for crops in the contiguous 48 states has increased by nearly two weeks since the beginning of the 20th century. A particularly large and steady increase has occurred over the last 30 years. The observed changes reflect earlier spring warming as well as later arrival of fall frosts.\nLearn More\nData source: Kunkel, 2016\nRagweed Pollen Season\nWarmer temperatures and later fall frosts allow ragweed plants to produce pollen later into the year, potentially prolonging the allergy season for millions of people. The length of ragweed pollen season has increased at 10 out of 11 locations studied in the central United States and Canada since 1995. The change becomes more pronounced from south to north.\nLearn More\nData source: Ziska et al., 2016\nWildfires\nSince 1983, the United States has had an average of 72,000 recorded wildfires per year. Of the 10 years with the largest acreage burned, nine have occurred since 2000, with many of the largest increases occurring in western states. The proportion of burned land suffering severe damage each year has ranged from 5 to 21 percent.\nLearn More\nStreamflow\nChanges in temperature, precipitation, snowpack, and glaciers can affect the rate of streamflow and the timing of peak flow. Over the last 75 years, minimum, maximum, and average flows have changed in many parts of the countryâ\x80\x94some higher, some lower. Most of the rivers and streams measured show peak winter-spring runoff happening at least five days earlier than it did in the mid-20th century.\nLearn More\nStream Temperature\nStream temperatures have risen throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. From 1960 through 2014, water temperature increased at 79 percent of the stream sites measured in the region. Temperature has risen by an average of 1.2Â°F across all sites and 2.2Â°F at the sites where trends were statistically significant.\nLearn More\nData source: Jastram and Rice, 2015\nGreat Lakes Water Levels and Temperatures\nWater levels in most of the Great Lakes have declined in the last few decades. However, the most recent levels are all within the range of historical variation. Water levels in lakes are influenced by water temperature, which affects evaporation rates and ice formation. Since 1995, average surface water temperatures have increased slightly for each of the Great Lakes.\nLearn More\nBird Wintering Ranges\nThe migration patterns and geographic ranges of some birds have shifted due to changes in temperature or other environmental conditions. Long-term studies have found that bird species in North America have shifted their wintering grounds northward by an average of more than 40 miles since 1966, with several species shifting by hundreds of miles.\nLearn More\nData source: National Audubon Society, 2014\nMarine Species Distribution\nIn conjunction with warming ocean waters, the average center of biomass for 105 marine fish and invertebrate species along U.S. coasts shifted northward by about 10 miles between 1982 and 2015. These species also moved an average of 20 feet deeper. Shifts have occurred among several economically important fish and shellfish species. For example, American lobster, red hake, and black sea bassÂ\xa0in the Northeast have moved northward by an average of 119 miles.\nLearn More\nLeaf and Bloom Dates\nLeaf growth and flower blooms are examples of natural events whose timing can be influenced by climate change. Observations of lilacs and honeysuckles in the contiguous 48 states suggest that first leaf dates and bloom dates show a great deal of year-to-year variability. Leaf and bloom events are generally happening earlier throughout the North and West but later in much of the South.\nLearn More\nData source: Schwartz, 2016\nMore Information\nVisit EPAâ\x80\x99s climate change indicators website (www.epa.gov/climate-indicators) to see all 37 indicators, read the full report, download graphs and maps from the report, and access supporting technical documentation.\nVisit EPAâ\x80\x99s broader climate change website (www.epa.gov/climatechange) to learn more about the impacts of climate change and the steps that society can take to adapt.\nRelated Topics\nContact Us to ask a question, provide feedback, or report a problem.\nLast updated on November 9, 2020\n""}]","{'tone': 'Somber', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'summary': ""The comments express deep concern and frustration over the Supreme Court's decision limiting the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which is seen as a major setback in the fight against climate change and environmental protection.""}","[""The Supreme Court's decision to limit the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is a devastating blow in the fight against climate change.

Fact Sheet | Climate, Environmental, and Health Impacts of Fossil Fuels (2021)
December 17, 2021
See also our latest white paper on fossil fuel subsidies.
The use of fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—results in significant climate, environmental, and health costs that are not reflected in market prices. These costs are known as externalities. Each stage of the fossil fuel supply chain, from extraction and transportation to refining and burning, generates externalities. This fact sheet provides a survey of some of the externalities associated with fossil fuels.
Climate Externalities
When fossil fuels are burned, they emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere and contribute to climate change. In 2019, fossil fuels accounted for 74 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 25 percent of emissions in the United States come from fossil fuels extracted from public lands. Some of the climate externalities of fossil fuels include:
Environmental Externalities
Fossil fuels have significant environmental externalities including:
Health Externalities
Air pollution from burning fossil fuels can cause multiple health issues, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, and premature death. Combusting the additives found in gasoline—benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene—produces cancer-causing ultra-fine particles and aromatic hydrocarbons. Globally, fossil fuel pollution is responsible for one in five deaths. In the United States, 350,000 premature deaths in 2018 were attributed to fossil fuel-related pollution, with the highest number of deaths per capita in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The annual cost of the health impacts of fossil fuel-generated electricity in the United States is estimated to be up to $886.5 billion.
The environmental and health impacts of fossil fuels disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to 56 and 63 percent more particulate matter pollution, respectively, than they produce. In a predominantly Black and low-income area of Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley,” the cancer risk is nearly 50 times higher than the national average due to 150 nearby chemical plants and oil refineries.
Policy Mechanisms to Reduce Fossil Fuel Externalities
Several policy mechanisms have been proposed to reduce fossil fuel externalities, including:

These costs are known as externalities. Each stage of the fossil fuel supply chain, from extraction and transportation to refining and burning, generates externalities. This fact sheet provides a survey of some of the externalities associated with fossil fuels.\nClimate Externalities\nWhen fossil fuels are burned, they emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere and contribute to climate change. In 2019, fossil fuels accounted for\xa074 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 25 percent of emissions in the United States come from fossil fuels extracted from public lands. Some of the climate externalities of fossil fuels include:\nEnvironmental Externalities\nFossil fuels have significant environmental externalities including:\nHealth Externalities\nAir pollution from burning fossil fuels can cause multiple health issues, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, and premature death. Combusting the additives found in gasoline—benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene—produces cancer-causing ultra-fine particles and aromatic hydrocarbons. Globally, fossil fuel pollution is responsible for one in five deaths. In the United States, 350,000 premature deaths in 2018 were attributed to fossil fuel-related pollution, with the highest number of deaths per capita in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The annual cost of the health impacts of fossil fuel-generated electricity in the United States is estimated to be up to $886.5 billion.\nThe environmental and health impacts of fossil fuels disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to 56 and 63 percent more particulate matter pollution, respectively, than they produce. In a predominantly Black and low-income area of Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley,” the cancer risk is nearly 50 times higher than the national average due to 150 nearby chemical plants and oil refineries.\nPolicy Mechanisms to Reduce Fossil Fuel Externalities\nSeveral policy mechanisms have been proposed to reduce fossil fuel externalities, including:\nAuthor: Savannah Bertrand\nEditor: Anna McGinn\nGraphic: Emma Johnson\nFor the endnotes, please download the PDF version of this issue brief.\nContact\nEESI RSS Feed\nPDF\nNewsletters\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Sign Up\nPodcast\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Episode List\nTags / Keywords\n1020 19th Street, NW, Suite 400\nWashington, DC 20036-6101\n(202) 628-1400 phone\n(202) 204-5244 fax\ninfo@eesi.org\nStaff directory\nEIN: 52-1268030\nEESI advances science-based solutions for climate change,\nenergy, and environmental challenges in order to achieve\nour vision of a sustainable, resilient, and equitable world.\nMore about EESI\nCopyright © Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI).

This year is setting up to be a momentous year in the movement for climate action. Scroll through your newsfeed, scan the day's headlines, and chances are you'll see something about climate change.
This is good news. Largely because, as the latest IPCC report published in March made extremely clear, we are out of time for talking. We have to see urgent and widespread action on climate change right now — and that means global, systemic transformation.
But it can get overwhelming. Both in terms of eco-anxiety — an international study in 2021 revealed that 60% of young people were very worried about climate change — but also in terms of the sheer amount of information to know.
International climate policy isn’t exactly taught in school (although many, such as activist Scarlett Westbrook, argue it should be) and a barrage of media stories might have left you wondering what the difference is between your ""net zero"", your “NDCs”, and your “nature-based solutions.”
So to help, here’s a handy glossary of all the climate-related words and phrases you should know about.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns within global or regional climate patterns. The main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels — such as coal, oil, and gas — to produce energy and power transport.
In addition to other human activities, like cutting down forests and farming, this releases heat-trapping pollution (called greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere, warming the planet and destabilizing the climate.
Climate change is already having a devastating impact on people all around the world, particularly through extreme weather events like heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, droughts, and floods. Climate change is also disproportionately impacting the world's poorest people and nations the most, despite these populations having contributed the least to climate change.
The climate crisis refers to the urgent need for immediate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and address the causes of climate change, and prevent serious and permanent damage to the environment.
Global warming refers to a long-term warming of the Earth’s surface overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Human activity has played a huge role in the increase of our planet’s temperature. Burning fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gases, which cause what's known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere — which locks heat into the earth's atmosphere and causes the average global temperature to rise.
Learn more about global warming and its causes and effects in our explainer here.
Fossil fuel is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources such as coal, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from dead plants and animals that existed millions of years ago, and can also be made by industrial processes from other fossil fuels.
When fossil fuels are burned they release harmful gases into the atmosphere and cause global warming (see above!). Fossil fuels currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy.
Debates about climate policy often refer to the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where did this limit come from, and why?
It refers to how we are tracking the world’s temperature in comparison to pre-industrial temperatures. The world is already 1.2C degrees warmer, and we’re seeing changes in weather and the climate as a result.
The idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body founded in 1988 to regularly assess all the available science on the changing global climate. Scientific predictions have been made about what the likely effect of incremental temperature rises would be — you can read about the differences between a 1.5, 2, and 3 degree rise here.
The Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015 committed all 196 countries that signed it to endeavoring to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees.
Loss and damage is a phrase you'll likely hear a lot, and it refers, to quote the UN Environment Program, ""to the negative consequences that arise from the unavoidable risks of climate change"" — things like, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more. There's no internationally agreed definition for loss and damage, but it typically refers to the destructive impacts of climate change.
When capitalized, Loss and Damage is typically used when referring to international climate negotiations and the plans and policies that address loss and damage. Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.
It’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.
With sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.
Climate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.
Dedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change's impacts.
In short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.
It is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.
At the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.
Find out more here about climate finance here.
Nature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.
These are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.
Forests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.
The goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”
That’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.
Net zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.
A number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.
Climate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.
It acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently — with the world's poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change — and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.
Renewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.
Extreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns — and it's becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we've witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.
Carbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).
The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.
It has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.
Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren't money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.
In a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.
The world’s biggest climate summit is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.
The COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.
The summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.
COP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”
Something that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.
These plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.
Currently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.
A climate refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It's estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.
There are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.
SIDS —  Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10. AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.

Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.\nHuman activity has played a huge role in the increase of our planet’s temperature.\xa0Burning fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gases, which\xa0cause what\'s known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere\xa0— which locks heat into the earth\'s atmosphere and causes the average global temperature to rise.\nLearn more about global warming and its causes and effects in our explainer here.\nFossil fuel is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources\xa0such as coal, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from dead plants and animals that existed millions of years ago, and can also be made by industrial processes\xa0from other fossil fuels.\nWhen fossil fuels are burned they release harmful gases into the atmosphere and cause global warming (see above!). Fossil fuels currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy.\nDebates about climate policy often refer to the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where did this limit come from, and why?\nIt refers to how we are tracking the world’s temperature in comparison to pre-industrial temperatures. The world is already 1.2C degrees warmer, and we’re seeing changes in weather and the climate as a result.\nThe idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body founded in 1988 to regularly assess all the available science on the changing global climate. Scientific predictions have been made about what the likely effect of incremental temperature rises would be — you can read about the differences between a 1.5, 2, and 3 degree rise here.\nThe Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015 committed all 196 countries that signed it to endeavoring to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees.\nLoss and damage is a phrase you\'ll likely hear a lot, and it refers, to quote the UN Environment Program, ""to the negative consequences that arise from the unavoidable risks of climate change"" — things like, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more. There\'s no internationally agreed definition for loss and damage, but it typically refers to the destructive impacts of climate change.\nWhen capitalized, Loss and Damage is typically used when referring to international climate negotiations and the plans and policies that address loss and damage. Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.\nIt’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.\nWith sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.\nClimate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.\nDedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change\'s impacts.\nIn short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.\nIt is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.\nAt the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.\nFind out more here about climate finance here.\nNature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.\nThese are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs\xa0to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.\nForests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.\nThe goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”\nThat’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.\nNet zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.\nA number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.\nClimate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.\nIt acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently\xa0— with the world\'s poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change —\xa0and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.\nRenewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.\nExtreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns\xa0— and it\'s becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we\'ve witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.\nCarbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere\xa0and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).\nThe Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries\xa0at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.\nIt has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.\nBiodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren\'t\xa0money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.\nIn a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.\nThe world’s biggest climate summit\xa0is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.\nThe COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.\nThe summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.\nCOP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”\nSomething that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit\xa0their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.\nThese plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.\nCurrently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report\xa0by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.\nA climate refugee is a person who has been\xa0forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas\xa0given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It\'s estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.\nThere are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.\nSIDS — \xa0Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10.\xa0AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.\nNow you know all about the key words and phrases relating to climate change, you can join us and Global Citizen around the world in taking action to address climate change.

    How climate change drives humanitarian crises


The triple threat of conflict, COVID-19 and climate change are dramatically worsening already dire situations around the globe. 
Climate change is set to unleash widespread and sustained damage across the world—even if we succeed in limiting global warming. 
This is not a problem for future generations to solve. The catastrophic consequences are already here as more frequent and intense natural disasters and extreme weather destroy livelihoods, intensify violent conflict, and force people to flee their homes. The impacts of COVID-19 have only compounded these threats to the lives of millions around the world. 
The need for bold and urgent action could not be clearer. Find out what you need to know.
What is climate change? 
Scientists estimate that the Earth has already warmed by 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century. With the exception of 1998, 19 of the warmest years on record occurred after 2000. 
There is overwhelming evidence that this warming is caused by human activity, specifically the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), composed of thousands of scientists, projects a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.
How climate change is transforming the planet 
Climate, the average temperature and precipitation over time, is distinct from weather, which refers to the day-to-day temperature, precipitation, or events like storms, and is influenced by a number of factors. It is difficult to say one specific weather event, such as a hurricane, is directly caused by climate change. However, scientists do know that global warming makes extreme weather more frequent and more intense.
Extreme weather encompasses heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes or other “megastorms” that transform communities in the blink of an eye. Extreme weather also contributes to less predictable rainy or dry seasons, the transformation of fertile land into desert (also called desertification) and sea level rise.
“When we talk about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, it sounds very esoteric,” says Tara Clerkin, a technical specialist supporting agriculture and climate livelihoods programming for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). “But I think in the last few years, we've all started to actually experience and feel in our own lives what those impacts of rising temperatures and increased emissions are. And that is even more true for the places in which the IRC works.”
Climate change exacerbates pre-existing risks 
Just as it is difficult to attribute an individual storm to climate change, a crisis can result from a combination of factors. Conflict increases when a drought causes food shortages, and hunger is worsened by the economic impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19.

Climate change works like this, as extreme weather events combine with already existing conflicts or other crises to make life even more difficult for those grappling with its impacts. 
Tara points to the conflict in Syria, which began in 2011 after years of drought. “Was climate change the sole reason for the civil war? No. Was it a contributing factor? Yes.” 
Ethiopia is another example. The country relies heavily on agriculture and has a history of drought and flooding, both of which climate change makes more likely. 
In 2020, Ethiopia and other East African countries such as Somalia and Kenya endured the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the largest outbreak of locusts in recent history, a phenomenon at least partly attributed to climate change. In Ethiopia alone, over 1 million people have lost crops due to the locusts and 11 million are expected to face crisis levels of food insecurity. Late in the year, a conflict broke out in the country’s Tigray region, further pushing the population toward crisis. 
“What we’re seeing is that multiple once-in-a-generation crises are happening in the same location and in the same year,” says Tara. 
Climate change also contributes to poor health outcomes. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are likely to exacerbate the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria. Lack of access to clean water will lead to higher incidence of diarrhea, a major cause of death for children under 5. Coupled with the destruction of fragile ecosystems, the changing climate has a profound impact on the occurrence of viruses like COVID-19 that emerge from animals. 
As the Earth warms, people move 
Farmers “live and die by the rain,” notes Tara, and in many regions rainfall is becoming increasingly erratic, forcing many farmers and herders to move in search of better lands or other work.  
As more farmers and other members of the community move, they often congregate in smaller areas where resources become scarce. Conflict becomes more likely, and that violence forces more people to flee their homes.
Tara cites Chad as an example of this cycle. Considered by at least one index the country in the world most vulnerable to climate change, Chad has one of the highest rates of hunger in the world—87 percent of Chad’s mostly rural population lives below the poverty line. It is also home to hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring countries. 
In addition, Chad, alongside its neighbors Niger and Cameroon, faces increasing violence from extremist groups who contribute to the region’s insecurity. 
“You have more people trying to earn a living from less land that is less fertile,” says Tara. “And then that just drives more conflict again.”
Climate change is also contributing to crises that are driving people in Central America from their homes. When hurricanes Eta and Iota slammed northern Central America within weeks of one another in November of 2020, they worsened the situation in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and other countries that were already plagued by gang violence and extreme poverty.
""The hurricanes were ... the last in the series of what was a devastating year,"" said Meghan Lopez, vice president of the IRC’s programs in Latin America, during an interview with CNN. ""To have the pandemic on top of that, to have aid to the region cut, all of these things create this pressure cooker where there's no escape valve. And the only escape valve is to try to flee the terrible situation people are living in ... People are making desperate decisions.""
Climate change has the biggest impact on people already living in crisis
A University of Notre Dame index recently ranked the top 10 countries most vulnerable to a warming climate; seven were also included in the IRC’s 2021 Emergency Watchlist featuring the countries most likely to face humanitarian crises in 2021. All ten countries are experiencing armed conflict.
Afghanistan is one of those countries. While the central Asian nation grapples with instability and a decades-long humanitarian crisis, it is also facing extreme drought. Around 634,800 people had been internally displaced as of September of 2021, a number likely to increase as the drought combines with COVID-19 and conflict to make the already volatile situation worse.
Unequal impacts are felt within countries, too. Whenever a crisis strikes, women and girls suffer disproportionately, and climate-related crises are no exception. 
“Women are usually responsible for household tasks, and this includes gardening, manual labor and farming, as well as getting water and firewood and feeding their families,” says Tara. “All of these are more challenging when climate change has impacted the local environment.” 
Gender-based violence also increases during a crisis. In Honduras, for instance, local organizations reported a 60 to 70 percent increase in reported cases of gender-based violence in the aftermath of two hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic. Women looking for help found themselves in overcrowded shelters suffering from a lack of privacy and increasing sexual violence.
What needs to happen 
“I think we are at the point where there's willingness and opportunity, and where we have solutions ready,” says Tara. “We're starting to figure out how we can actually move the needle to reduce emissions and vulnerability.” 
I think we are at the point where there's willingness and opportunity, and where we have solutions ready.
It is critical that humanitarian institutions call out the lack of global political leadership during the pandemic—and ensure we don’t repeat the same mistakes.
Tara sees hope in programs that build “climate resilience,” which means that they prepare communities to confront the impacts of climate change while also taking steps to lessen greenhouse gas emissions, prevent environmental degradation, and rebuild biodiversity. 
It also means preparing for future climate emergencies, with communities given financial support and decision-making power. Local leaders (particularly indigenous populations), smallholder farmers and livestock herders already have the knowledge and experience necessary to confront this crisis. 
“There needs to be more respect for the generations of experience these leaders have in managing and maintaining their own land,” Tara says.
Future response to climate change must also be feminist, recognizing the unique and disproportionate ways women are impacted. As farmers, carers or activists, women (and women-led organizations) are central to food security and effective climate change mitigation.
None of these efforts can happen without innovation. We need to create and roll out breakthrough technologies that tackle the world’s most pressing climate-related problems, while building on local and indigenous knowledge and expertise on climate resilience and natural resource management.
How the IRC fights climate change
The IRC helps communities respond to the changing climate by mapping climate hazards and developing early warning systems, supporting community-led natural resource management and water conservation, and training people in sustainable livelihoods—all while putting women and girls’ needs at the center of our programs. 
The IRC has also developed partnerships for advocacy and policy change. We are a signatory to the InterAction NGO Climate Compact, a promise to advance the global agenda to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the effects of climate change on people with the least power and fewest resources. 
This commitment is also reflected in the IRC’s long-term strategy. Our climate action plan puts forward an ambitious agenda to reduce our own organizational carbon footprint by pairing our community programs with concrete changes to our operational delivery, without comprising the depth or quality of support we offer communities responding to climate change.

When hurricanes Eta and Iota slammed northern Central America within weeks of one another in November of 2020, they worsened the situation in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and other countries that were already plagued by gang violence and extreme poverty.\n""The hurricanes were ... the last in the series of what was a devastating year,"" said Meghan Lopez, vice president of the IRC’s programs in Latin America, during an interview with CNN. ""To have the pandemic on top of that, to have aid to the region cut, all of these things create this pressure cooker where there\'s no escape valve. And the only escape valve is to try to flee the terrible situation people are living in ... People are making desperate decisions.""\nClimate change has the biggest impact on people already living in crisis\nA\xa0University of Notre Dame\xa0index\xa0recently ranked the top 10 countries most vulnerable to a warming climate; seven were also included in the IRC’s 2021 Emergency Watchlist featuring the countries most likely to face humanitarian crises in 2021. All ten countries are experiencing armed conflict.\nAfghanistan is one of those countries.\xa0While the central Asian nation grapples with instability and a decades-long humanitarian crisis, it is also facing extreme drought. Around 634,800 people had been internally displaced as of September of 2021, a number likely to increase as the drought combines with COVID-19 and conflict to make the already volatile situation worse.\nUnequal impacts are felt within countries, too. Whenever a crisis strikes, women and girls suffer disproportionately, and climate-related crises are no exception.\xa0\n“Women are usually responsible for household tasks, and this includes gardening, manual labor and farming, as well as getting water and firewood and feeding their families,” says Tara. “All of these are more challenging when climate change has impacted the local environment.”\xa0\nGender-based violence also increases during a crisis. In Honduras, for instance, local organizations reported a 60 to 70 percent increase in reported cases of gender-based violence in the aftermath of two hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic. Women looking for help found themselves in overcrowded shelters suffering from a lack of privacy and increasing sexual violence.\nWhat needs to happen\xa0\n“I think we are at the point where there\'s willingness and opportunity, and where we have solutions ready,” says Tara. “We\'re starting to figure out how we can actually move the needle to reduce emissions and vulnerability.”\xa0\nI think we are at the point where there\'s willingness and opportunity, and where we have solutions ready.\nIt is critical that humanitarian institutions call out the lack of global political leadership during the pandemic—and ensure we don’t repeat the same mistakes.\nTara sees hope in programs that build “climate resilience,” which means that they prepare communities to confront the impacts of climate change while also taking steps to lessen greenhouse gas emissions, prevent environmental degradation, and rebuild biodiversity.\xa0\nIt also means preparing for future climate emergencies, with communities given financial support and decision-making power. Local leaders (particularly indigenous populations), smallholder farmers and livestock herders already have the knowledge and experience necessary to confront this crisis.\xa0\n“There needs to be more respect for the generations of experience these leaders have in managing and maintaining their own land,” Tara says.\nFuture response to climate change must also be feminist, recognizing the unique and disproportionate ways women are impacted. As farmers, carers or activists, women (and women-led organizations) are central to food security and effective climate change mitigation.\nNone of these efforts can happen without innovation. We need to create and roll out breakthrough technologies that tackle the world’s most pressing climate-related problems, while building on local and indigenous knowledge and expertise on climate resilience and natural resource management.\nHow the IRC fights climate change\nThe IRC helps communities respond to the changing climate by mapping climate hazards and developing early warning systems, supporting community-led natural resource management and water conservation, and training people in sustainable livelihoods—all while putting women and girls’ needs at the center of our programs.\xa0\nThe IRC has also developed partnerships for advocacy and policy change. We are a signatory to the InterAction NGO Climate Compact, a promise to advance the global agenda to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the effects of climate change on people with the least power and fewest resources.\xa0\nThis commitment is also reflected in the IRC’s long-term strategy. Our climate action plan puts forward an ambitious agenda to reduce our own organizational carbon footprint by pairing our community programs with concrete changes to our operational delivery, without comprising the depth or quality of support we offer communities responding to climate change.\nClimate change facts\nWhat is climate change?\xa0 l\xa0 Which countries are most affected by climate change? l\xa0 Climate crisis stats\xa0 l\xa0 Climate crisis in focus: Afghanistan\n\xa0\nSupport our work\nExplore related topics:\nRelated news & features\n\n    Get the latest news about the IRC\'s innovative programs, compelling stories about our clients and how you can make a difference.\n     \n\n  \n  \n          \n        \n                  \n \n    \nSubscribe\n'}]","{'tone': 'Frustrated', 'sentiment': 'Negative', 'summary': 'The comments express frustration over the lack of funding for addressing climate change while the government continues to spend heavily on other areas like the military and supporting the wealthy.

Federal government has on Saturday, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with two Chinese corporations to improve electricity and water supply in Abuja.
Gatekeepers News reports that FCT minister, Nyesom Wike announced the deal through a statement released on Sunday.
The MoU was signed with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and China Geo-Engineering Corporation Overseas Construction (CGCOC) Group in Beijing.
Wike noted that the signing ceremony took place during President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s visit to China, where he attended the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing.
According to him; Tinubu advocated for the projects as part of his agenda to renew the hope of Abuja residents in the government through execution of people-oriented projects.
The minister assured that the projects would be completed in 2025 and inaugurated as part of activities to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the state.
He said, “One key project which is very dear to us and one of the reasons why we are here today is to light up Abuja.”
“We want Abuja to be like other cities, like what we see in Beijing. We have gone round, and we have seen light everywhere; that is how we want Abuja to be.”
“Therefore, the whole area of Maitama; the whole area of Asokoro, Wuse, Central Business District, and Airport Road, down to Bill Clinton Drive will be handled by CCECC, while CGCOC Group would handle the districts of Mabushi, Katampe and Garki.”
“On the need to equally ensure water supply in the satellite areas of the FCT, we are keeping up with the idea that there is a need to have satellite town water supply in Gwagwalada, Kwali and Kuje as directed by Tinubu.”
“We have now signed the MoU with CGCOC Group for them to carry out this assignment.”
Wike revealed that the greater Abuja water works project, handled by CGCOC Group, has reached 75 percent completion, and would be completed by December this year.
He further thanked Tinubu for granting the FCT administration approval for the projects and urged CGCOC Group to ensure quick delivery of the project.
The minister emphasised that this would ensure that water supply in satellite towns becomes a reality.

Education is key to empowering young people to respond to climate change. It’s something that will reach into every aspect of their lives in complex ways. However, the national curriculum largely confines climate change to a few subjects, meaning teachers in other disciplines often feel out of their depth. 
A survey carried out in England in 2021 found that 70% of the teachers surveyed, across all disciplines, felt they haven’t received any training at all for teaching climate change. The situation is fairly similar in countries such as the USA and Australia.
In particular, education on climate adaptation – the way people adjust to the impacts of climate change – may be particularly challenging for teachers. In general, issues such as climate refugees, the case for reparations to developing countries, or the need to prepare for food supply issues or extreme weather events are politically complex. Teachers may fear that teaching about these issues, which do not have easy solutions, may make their students anxious.
A focus on climate adaptation may also be seen as a distraction from educating on climate mitigation –preventing climate change from happening.
One way to make teaching about climate adaptation less potentially daunting for teachers is to draw on personal experience, particularly when conveyed through the creative arts. Our research in secondary schools and youth organisations has found that one effective way of doing this is to help young people to exchange their experiences, both among themselves and with communities most impacted by climate change.
For our recent project with colleague, director of the Institute for Social Justice Matthew Reason, we worked with young people in a UK secondary school and two youth clubs. The young people connected online with Nigerian students and a US-based climate podcaster to talk about their experiences of climate adaptation.
Listening to each other’s stories
The project allowed students to explore different perspectives and consider the relationships between different issues in a global system. For example, Nigerian students struggled with excessive heat, but also unseasonably cold weather that brought dangerous cold-season animals out all year round. Students’ stories of their own relatives in Pakistan, Turkey, Australia and other countries cast light on the importance of local knowledge in building community resilience to flooding or wildfires.
The UK students connected the impact of globalisation on climate change, such as international trade which generates enormous greenhouse gas emissions, to its effect on the local economy of their Yorkshire town. They discussed how locally owned shops were under pressure from chain stores.
All the young people in England went on to develop and share performances of climate adaptation stories. In seven small groups, the young people used what they learnt to create short storytelling performances using only props that could be packed into suitcases. They communicated how people are already experiencing the effects of climate change and what we can learn from how they are adapting.
The beauty of storytelling-led approaches to educating on complex issues is that every narrative is unique and complete. Stories contain elements drawn from social, moral, personal, technical and scientific spheres of knowledge. 
Existing knowledge
This means that rather than teachers needing to acquire extensive expertise about climate adaptation, they can start by building upon knowledge that already exists within their students’ and their own lives.
The students’ learning about climate adaptation occurred as they also formed meaningful relationships with each other. This gave their stories the power and significance of the first-person witness. 
The mutual learning environment helped students appreciate the gaps in their knowledge of each other’s environment. One Nigerian student was surprised by the UK students’ reports of floods and droughts, responding that they “learnt that the effects of climate change in Africa are little different from its effects in the UK”. 
Learning through connection and stories also helped the students focus on climate adaptation in a way that avoided climate anxiety. One student in England said: 
I think I’ve learned how to pick up on issues. Like how they can be  solved. Looking at it more into kind of what can be done and the people around it. So I think now I’d look more into what can be done, and how can we solve it, more than like being upset about it.
Our surveys of the students found that they were much more likely to agree with the statement “I know about some things I could do or get involved with to tackle climate change or help people adapt to it” after they had completed the project. 
Exploring a difficult, unbounded topic such as climate change through participatory storytelling provides young people with emotionally meaningful connections to it, and a way to contain and express their fears about the future.  
Enhancing this with curious enquiry into the experiences of communities on elsewhere in the world can allow them to link their local experiences of climate adaptation to the global picture.

EPA Publishes its 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan
June 20, 2024
WASHINGTON — Today, June 20, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released its 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan, which describes agency actions to address the impacts of climate change and help build a more climate-resilient nation. The plan expands the agency’s efforts to ensure its programs, facilities, workforce and operations are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts. EPA plays a central role in the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to tackle the climate crisis and build a climate-resilient nation.
The plan builds on work initiated in the 2014 and 2021 EPA Climate Adaptation Plans to incorporate climate adaptation into the agency’s programs, policies, rules, enforcement activities and operations. EPA has already made significant strides partnering with other federal agencies, states, Tribes, territories and local governments to promote climate resilience across the nation, placing a particular focus on advancing environmental justice. Nevertheless, more needs to be done given the magnitude of this global challenge.
“We’re already seeing the devastating impacts of climate change in our daily lives, such as more frequent and intense weather events,” said Vicki Arroyo, EPA Associate Administrator for Policy. “The publication of EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan supports our continuing efforts to prepare for these impacts, build resilience, and support climate-smart solutions and investments that work for communities across the country.”
“We are strengthening EPA’s ability to adapt, and building a more climate-informed workforce,” said Kimberly Patrick, EPA Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for Mission Support. “The plan lays out our roadmap for the next four years to reinforce our facilities, critical infrastructure, supply chains and procurement processes to withstand potential risks posed by climate change – above all, to safeguard our workforce so that they can continue to carry out our mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Highlights from EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan are included below.
In March 2024, EPA launched a new Office of Climate Adaptation and Sustainability that will support efforts to build resilience to climate change and promote sustainability in support of the agency’s mission and its partnerships. Find EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan on our climate adaptation website.
BACKGROUND
President Biden directed federal agencies to meet the challenge of the climate crisis in a way that protects federal investments, grows good jobs and industries and makes the nation more economically competitive. That includes making federal agencies and programs more resilient to the climate crisis.
“As communities face extreme heat, natural disasters and severe weather from the impacts of climate change, President Biden is delivering record resources to build climate resilience across the country,” said Brenda Mallory, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Through his Investing in America agenda and an all-of-government approach to tackling the climate crisis, the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering more than $50 billion to help communities increase their resilience and bolster protections for those who need it most. By updating our own adaptation strategies, the federal government is leading by example to build a more resilient future for all.”
Federal agencies have been making steady progress on efforts to build adaptive capacity and resilience across federal operations. Today’s publication of EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan is part of a coordinated release of more than twenty federal agencies’ climate adaptation plans. These plans highlight efforts across the federal government to ensure federal facilities, employees, resources and operations are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts.
Each agency’s plan aligns with adaptation and resilience requirements in section 211 of Executive Order 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, section 5(d) of EO 14030: Climate-Related Financial Risk, and section 503 of EO 14057: Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability. The plans also demonstrate how agencies are contributing to the objectives and opportunities for action identified in the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Climate Resilience Framework and incorporating natural hazards and climate resilience into real property asset management and investment decisions (per the Disaster Recovery Planning Act and Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies M-24-03).
All plans from each of the agencies and more information are available at the Federal Sustainability Plan website.

EPA plays a central role in the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to tackle the climate crisis and build a climate-resilient nation.\nThe plan builds on work initiated in the 2014 and 2021 EPA Climate Adaptation Plans to incorporate climate adaptation into the agency’s programs, policies, rules, enforcement activities and operations. EPA has already made significant strides partnering with other federal agencies, states, Tribes, territories and local governments to promote climate resilience across the nation, placing a particular focus on advancing environmental justice. Nevertheless, more needs to be done given the magnitude of this global challenge.\n“We’re already seeing the devastating impacts of climate change in our daily lives, such as more frequent and intense weather events,” said Vicki Arroyo, EPA Associate Administrator for Policy. “The publication of EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan supports our continuing efforts to prepare for these impacts, build resilience, and support climate-smart solutions and investments that work for communities across the country.”\n“We are strengthening EPA’s ability to adapt, and building a more climate-informed workforce,” said Kimberly Patrick, EPA Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for Mission Support. “The plan lays out our roadmap for the next four years to reinforce our facilities, critical infrastructure, supply chains and procurement processes to withstand potential risks posed by climate change – above all, to safeguard our workforce so that they can continue to carry out our mission of protecting human health and the environment.”\nHighlights from EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan are included below.\nIn March 2024, EPA launched a new Office of Climate Adaptation and Sustainability that will support efforts to build resilience to climate change and promote sustainability in support of the agency’s mission and its partnerships. Find EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan on our climate adaptation website.\nBACKGROUND\nPresident Biden directed federal agencies to meet the challenge of the climate crisis in a way that protects federal investments, grows good jobs and industries and makes the nation more economically competitive. That includes making federal agencies and programs more resilient to the climate crisis.\n“As communities face extreme heat, natural disasters and severe weather from the impacts of climate change, President Biden is delivering record resources to build climate resilience across the country,” said Brenda Mallory, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Through his Investing in America agenda and an all-of-government approach to tackling the climate crisis, the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering more than $50 billion to help communities increase their resilience and bolster protections for those who need it most. By updating our own adaptation strategies, the federal government is leading by example to build a more resilient future for all.”\nFederal agencies have been making steady progress on efforts to build adaptive capacity and resilience across federal operations. Today’s publication of EPA’s 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan is part of a coordinated release of more than twenty federal agencies’ climate adaptation plans. These plans highlight efforts across the federal government to ensure federal facilities, employees, resources and operations are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts.\nEach agency’s plan aligns with adaptation and resilience requirements in section 211 of Executive Order 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, section 5(d) of EO 14030: Climate-Related Financial Risk, and section 503 of EO 14057: Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability. The plans also demonstrate how agencies are contributing to the objectives and opportunities for action identified in the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Climate Resilience Framework and incorporating natural hazards and climate resilience into real property asset management and investment decisions (per the Disaster Recovery Planning Act and Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies M-24-03).\nAll plans from each of the agencies and more information are available at the Federal Sustainability Plan website.\nDiscover.\nConnect.\nAsk.\nFollow.'}]","{'tone': 'critical', 'sentiment': 'negative', 'summary': 'The main point expressed in the comments is that the root cause of the climate crisis is the capitalist system, which prioritizes profit and growth over environmental sustainability.

As evident from the EPA's 2024-2027 Climate Adaptation Plan (https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-publishes-its-2024-2027-climate-adaptation-plan-0), the Biden-Harris administration is implementing a comprehensive, all-of-government approach to build climate resilience and support clean energy solutions. Claiming that the capitalist system is incapable of addressing climate change ignores the significant investments, policies, and collaborations underway to drive sustainable progress. While challenges remain, dismissing the real efforts of federal agencies like the EPA is shortsighted and fails to recognize the meaningful steps being taken.""]"

            Ask An SEO: How To Find The Right Long-tail Keywords For Articles        
Learn how to find the right long tail keywords for articles and avoid keyword cannibalization. Improve your content strategy with non-traditional research methods.
This week’s Ask An SEO question comes from Carrazana in Cuba, who asks:

“How do you find the right, long-tail keywords for articles? I can not find the right keywords and long tail keywords for my post and articles. I use keywords everywhere.”
Great question, Carrazana! Lots of content professionals struggle with finding long tail keywords, and many worry about cross-over between posts, also known as keyword and topic cannibalization.
The way to find long tail keywords and prevent cannibalization is to change your mindset on needing keywords by article and incorporate non-traditional research tools. So, let’s solve this so it is no longer an obstacle for you.
I’m going to start by addressing cannibalization, then jump into using non-traditional keyword research methods like LinkedIn hashtags and strategies our agency uses to generate ideas for our clients.
One thing I’d like to emphasize is to not focus on keywords; focus on the topic, and providing the best possible user experience for the intent of the topic.
Cannibalization
Instead of thinking about the keywords that are needed, think about the topic that you’re writing for.
The same words and phrases could mean different things and have different intent based on the topic, even if they’re used in the same way. Not in the sense of a homonym or double entendre, but as in search intent.
The same phrase for the service should exist in multiple pages of content, including product or service pages for conversions, and in guides to help consumers learn more, decide where to purchase, or how to prepare. The difference here is the topic changes based on the intent.
On the conversion page, the phrase needs to reinforce that this is a page that the consumer can take action on. For a how-to guide, it is more informative and should help the consumer know how to do it themselves, prepare for the professional to come and visit, or learn how to hire the right person for the job.
Search engines are smart enough to know the intent of content and can show it as needed. This is why you want to have a clear intent when creating content.
If you sell apples, do not define what an apple is on your product or service page.
The person already knows; instead, define it on a blog post about “what an apple is.” The product or service page should be about the benefits of using the specific apple, like baking, eating it directly, or feeding it to specific animals as a treat.
Your blog posts can include definitions, guides, and comparisons of which apples are better for specific purposes and why, as well as other non-conversion-oriented content.
Both the product page and at least one guide will have “apples for horses,” but the intent is different.
One page clearly shows where you can buy an apple to feed a horse, while the other explains why that particular apple is better for horses, which may be its nutritional value or the way a horse’s tastebuds and body respond to the sugar or fiber content.
I’m making this up for the example; don’t take it as factual advice. You can deploy schema to let the search engines know when to show each page based on search intent.
Product and service schema goes on the pages where you want conversions, and article or blog posting schema can go on the guides and informative ones. The machine learning portions of the search engine will look at the associations around the text while other aspects read the schema to determine what the purpose of the page is.
Proper implementation and clear wording make the search engine’s job easy and reduce the chance of cannibalization. Now that you know how to prevent cannibalization, let’s go into finding long tail keyword topics.
Finding Long-Tail Keyword Phrases
Finding long-tail keyword phrases is simple when you step outside of the normal tool sets.  You have data points your competitors and third parties don’t have access to using customer data, and there are non-traditional places you can search.
Customer Support
Start by reading customer service and live chat transcripts. See if you can extract questions that mention specific products or services or by a category like blue t-shirts or red apples. With this information, you can see the words and language your customers are using, and how frequently.
These become long tail phrases for content on all forms of pages. You can also see the questions they have, reasons they return product, and recommendations customer support offers to guide them to the correct option to purchase.
These data points lead to sizing guides and comparison shopping content, articles about one fabric being better than another for a purpose like cocktail parties or running a marathon, and answer questions for the shopping and checkout process.
You may also find that these are questions being asked about your competitors like which of their models is similar to a specific product on your website.
You can create solutions on your site to bring in this type of traffic by answering their customers’ questions and optimizing your site for them via search.
LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, And Other Hashtag Sites
Social media sites that power part of their search and algorithm with hashtags are a goldmine of topics.
Go to LinkedIn and click on a hashtag like #SEO or #business. You’ll see how many people subscribe to it, how often it is used, and engagement on new content published within the hashtag’s feed.
If the hashtag is being used regularly and has engagement, look at the posts that exist within it. By knowing which gets the most comments, activity, and other signals, you can use them as a basis for new content on your own website.
As a bonus, they can be shared on these social platforms and hopefully get social media engagement too.
Bonus tip: The most engaged may only be engaged because the person or company that shared has an active following.  Look for three that are similar in topic and see if two of the three have engagement to determine if it has the potential for a bit of virality on social media.
Forums And Q&A Sites
Next, use forums and question-and-answer sites. Take a Reddit forum and plug it into an SEO tool like Semrush, Ahrefs, or Moz to see the keywords and phrases they’re ranking for.
You may find a lot of long tail that could be relevant to your own product or service offerings.
Then look at the specific threads showing up for these phrases and see if there are new long-tail keyword phrases being used by the community. This gives you insight into their mindset – compare it with your own live chat and customer service data.
Q&A Keyword Tools
There are some great tools out there to find long-tail phrases, like AlsoAsked.com and AnswerThePublic.com.  When you type a keyword phrase in you can see the ideas these tools come up with for topics to write about and the keywords the tools feel are related to the main topic.
Use Autocomplete On YouTube And Search Engines
The last tip is to use auto-complete on search engines, including YouTube. Once on YouTube, type in a portion of a phrase or a keyword and you’ll see it begin to autofill potential matches.
When there’s one that is relevant for your audience, click it and then look at the titles and descriptions from each video.
Many creators use chapters, and these chapters are what the content creator found to be helpful and relevant to the phrase. Each can become topics and phrases for you as well. Next, watch each video, listen to the wording and phrases the YouTuber uses, and read the comments section below.
You’ll learn the questions that weren’t answered in the video, the jargon users use, and find more content ideas as well as gaps you can fill in to bring new information into the mix. This same strategy applies to TikTok, Instagram Reels, and other video content platforms.
There’s no shortage of ways to find long-tail keyword phrases; the only limit is your own creativity.
As a content writer and SEO professional, you have tons of it! I hope this post helps you find more to write about.

This year is setting up to be a momentous year in the movement for climate action. Scroll through your newsfeed, scan the day's headlines, and chances are you'll see something about climate change.
This is good news. Largely because, as the latest IPCC report published in March made extremely clear, we are out of time for talking. We have to see urgent and widespread action on climate change right now — and that means global, systemic transformation.
But it can get overwhelming. Both in terms of eco-anxiety — an international study in 2021 revealed that 60% of young people were very worried about climate change — but also in terms of the sheer amount of information to know.
International climate policy isn’t exactly taught in school (although many, such as activist Scarlett Westbrook, argue it should be) and a barrage of media stories might have left you wondering what the difference is between your ""net zero"", your “NDCs”, and your “nature-based solutions.”
So to help, here’s a handy glossary of all the climate-related words and phrases you should know about.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns within global or regional climate patterns. The main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels — such as coal, oil, and gas — to produce energy and power transport.
In addition to other human activities, like cutting down forests and farming, this releases heat-trapping pollution (called greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere, warming the planet and destabilizing the climate.
Climate change is already having a devastating impact on people all around the world, particularly through extreme weather events like heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, droughts, and floods. Climate change is also disproportionately impacting the world's poorest people and nations the most, despite these populations having contributed the least to climate change.
The climate crisis refers to the urgent need for immediate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and address the causes of climate change, and prevent serious and permanent damage to the environment.
Global warming refers to a long-term warming of the Earth’s surface overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Human activity has played a huge role in the increase of our planet’s temperature. Burning fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gases, which cause what's known as the “greenhouse effect” in earth’s atmosphere — which locks heat into the earth's atmosphere and causes the average global temperature to rise.
Learn more about global warming and its causes and effects in our explainer here.
Fossil fuel is a generic term for non-renewable energy sources such as coal, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and non-renewable wastes. These fuels originate from dead plants and animals that existed millions of years ago, and can also be made by industrial processes from other fossil fuels.
When fossil fuels are burned they release harmful gases into the atmosphere and cause global warming (see above!). Fossil fuels currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy.
Debates about climate policy often refer to the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But where did this limit come from, and why?
It refers to how we are tracking the world’s temperature in comparison to pre-industrial temperatures. The world is already 1.2C degrees warmer, and we’re seeing changes in weather and the climate as a result.
The idea of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body founded in 1988 to regularly assess all the available science on the changing global climate. Scientific predictions have been made about what the likely effect of incremental temperature rises would be — you can read about the differences between a 1.5, 2, and 3 degree rise here.
The Paris Agreement signed at COP21 in 2015 committed all 196 countries that signed it to endeavoring to keep global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees.
Loss and damage is a phrase you'll likely hear a lot, and it refers, to quote the UN Environment Program, ""to the negative consequences that arise from the unavoidable risks of climate change"" — things like, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more. There's no internationally agreed definition for loss and damage, but it typically refers to the destructive impacts of climate change.
When capitalized, Loss and Damage is typically used when referring to international climate negotiations and the plans and policies that address loss and damage. Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.
It’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.
With sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.
Climate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.
Dedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change's impacts.
In short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.
It is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.
At the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.
Find out more here about climate finance here.
Nature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.
These are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.
Forests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.
The goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”
That’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.
Net zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.
A number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.
Climate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.
It acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently — with the world's poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change — and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.
Renewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.
Extreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns — and it's becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we've witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.
Carbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).
The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.
It has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.
Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren't money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.
In a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.
The world’s biggest climate summit is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.
The COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.
The summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.
COP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”
Something that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.
These plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.
Currently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.
A climate refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It's estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.
There are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.
SIDS —  Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10. AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.

Loss and Damage is incredibly important in addressing the injustice of climate change — with low-income and climate-vulnerable countries disproportionately experiencing the impacts of climate change and the mounting costs that result from loss and damage, despite having contributed the least to the causes of climate change.\nIt’s vital that countries drastically cut carbon emissions to address climate change — but our climate is already changing and, as such, countries also need to adapt.\nWith sea levels already rising and extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, it’s clear that to protect vulnerable communities from the worst impacts, a significant amount of adaptation is required.\nClimate adaptation can take many forms. It can mean building flood defenses, but it can also mean strengthening food systems so that they can withstand shocks. It’s important that wealthy countries, that have done the most to cause climate change, step up and support lower-income countries with this process of adaptation. You can learn more about climate adaptation here.\nDedicated and ring-fenced climate finance is what is needed to help fund efforts to address climate change — from cutting carbon emissions and shifting to clean energy, to adapting to climate change\'s impacts.\nIn short, billions of dollars are needed to address the increased poverty that climate change causes, to bolster systems to cope with its effects, and to support low- and middle-income countries to manage a just transition to greener economies.\nIt is especially important that funds are mobilized to help the poorest communities globally — those that did the least to cause the climate crisis but are bearing the brunt of the consequences.\nAt the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, high-income economies pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to fund adaptation and mitigation projects by 2020. However that promised funding has yet to be delivered. You can take action and join the call on world leaders to deliver the funding.\nFind out more here about climate finance here.\nNature-based solutions are an important aspect of the multi-pronged approach to fighting climate change. They are any action that works to sustainably manage, restore, and protect natural ecosystems — which in turn help build resilience to the impacts of climate change.\nThese are solutions like restoring mangrove forests to help provide an effective natural barrier against coastal flooding, or massive tree-planting, restoring, and protection programs\xa0to help ensure the world’s forests can effectively absorb carbon.\nForests and land ecosystems are what is known as “carbon sinks"" and help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, so many scientists advocate for “rewilding” — letting natural ecosystems restore to their natural state — to help the world recover. Read more here about groups that are leading the way with nature-based solutions.\nThe goal of the climate action taken by governments and societies around the world is to reach “net zero.”\nThat’s the state where no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are going into the atmosphere than can be taken out, and it means cutting emissions to as close to zero as possible.\nNet zero is a simple goal that requires radical action to achieve. It will mean transitioning economies relying on fossil fuels for power towards renewable sources of energy instead.\nA number of states — including the UK, the US, France, New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan — have set goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve this, decisive action needs to be taken right now to curb emissions. Find out more about the net zero goal and how we get there here, and about the UN-led campaign to cut emissions called the “Race to Zero” here.\nClimate justice refers to the intersectionality of the climate crisis as a social and political problem, as well as an environmental one.\nIt acknowledges that different communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently\xa0— with the world\'s poorest and most marginalized people being the most heavily impacted by climate change —\xa0and that the responsibility for causing and addressing the crisis rests with some more than others.\nRenewable energy refers to sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power; and they are the types of energy sources the world needs to be shifting to to effectively tackle climate change.\nExtreme weather refers to any weather that falls outside of normal patterns\xa0— and it\'s becoming increasingly frequent and intense as a result of climate change. Already in 2023 we\'ve witnessed numerous extreme and record-breaking weather events, from a heatwave across Asia, to Cyclone Freddy in southern and eastern Africa, to drought in the Horn of Africa, and more.\nCarbon emissions means carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted when fossil fuels are burned in vehicles, buildings, industrial processes, and so on. CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is warming the atmosphere\xa0and contributing to global warming. There are however six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, often referred to together as ""carbon dioxide equivalent"" (CO2e).\nThe Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries\xa0at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris on Dec. 12, 2015 and was implemented on Nov. 4, 2016.\nIt has a main goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5C; while other parts of the agreement focus on adaptation, education, financing, and how climate action can help achieve other UN Global Goals in the mission to end extreme poverty.\nBiodiversity refers to the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. However, many species are being threatened with extinction due to human activities and climate change, putting the Earth’s magnificent biodiversity at risk.\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) are reserve assets that can be traded between countries in exchange for liquidity, or cash. SDRs aren\'t\xa0money in the classic sense because they can’t be used to buy things, only to exchange, but they do have value.\nIn a nutshell, SDRs are basically coupons that countries can exchange with other countries for cash when they need immediate financial assistance, for example to buy essential supplies like vaccines, and support their economies.\nThe world’s biggest climate summit\xa0is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as a COP.\nThe COP happening later in 2023 is COP28 and it presents a historic opportunity for nations to agree to life-saving commitments to cut emissions, ensure climate finance, and curb run-away climate change. Taking place in Dubai from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, world leaders, diplomats, NGOs, activists, and the media will be traveling to the city to take part.\nThe summit is convened every year by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is a UN agency focused on, you guessed it, the climate.\nCOP is short for “Conference of the Parties” and essentially means a “gathering of countries.” This year will be the 28th time the conference has happened, hence the name “COP28.”\nSomething that has been part of past COP summits discussion are “NDCs”, short for “Nationally Determined Contributions”. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have to submit\xa0their plans to cut emissions — their “contribution” to the global effort to tackle climate change.\nThese plans detail when the country expects to reach peak emissions, and when they will reach “net zero” and what that trajectory looks like. The NDCs are seen as a work in progress, and need to be updated every five years to reflect greater ambition, providing more targeted information about how each country plans to achieve net zero.\nCurrently the NDCs submitted do not go far enough to curb warming to 1.5 degrees. According to a 2022 report\xa0by the United Nations, the world is currently on track for a temperature rise between 2.4C and 2.6C by 2100. Head here for a more detailed look at NDCs.\nA climate refugee is a person who has been\xa0forced to leave their home because the effects of climate change has made it impossible for them to stay. Climate visas, meanwhile, refers to visas\xa0given to people fleeing natural disasters caused by climate change; providing a safe and legal route for climate refugees to enter a country.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, between 2008 and 2016, an average of 21.5 million people were displaced annually by extreme weather events. It\'s estimated that, by 2050, the climate crisis could force more than a billion people from their homes.\nThere are few acronyms that refer to groups of countries or organizations that you might hear referred to in conversations about the climate.\nSIDS — \xa0Small Island Developing States, referring to a group of 58 low-lying island nations that are vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. They also face threats from heavy rains, increased cyclones, and ocean acidification. Leaders from SIDS nations have been clear about the need for wealthy countries to keep their promises on tackling climate change.G20 — The G20 is a forum of the 20 biggest economies in the world, made up of 19 nations and the European Union. Efforts to cut emissions must be led by these economies, which together account for between 75-80% of global trade and are home to around two-thirds of the global population. The 2023 G20 summit is to be held in New Delhi on Sept. 9 and 10.\xa0AGN — The African Group of Negotiators was established at the very first COP meeting in Berlin in 1995. It’s made up of representatives from an alliance of African states to speak together at climate change negotiations.\nNow you know all about the key words and phrases relating to climate change, you can join us and Global Citizen around the world in taking action to address climate change.
